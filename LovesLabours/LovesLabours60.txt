No, to the death, we will not move a foot;
Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,
But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.
BOYET
Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
And quite divorce his memory from his part.
PRINCESS
Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out
There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,
To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:
So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.
Trumpets sound within

BOYET
The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.
The Ladies mask

Enter Blackamoors with music; MOTH; FERDINAND, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in Russian habits, and masked

MOTH
All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!--
BOYET
Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.
MOTH
A holy parcel of the fairest dames.
The Ladies turn their backs to him

That ever turn'd their--backs--to mortal views!
BIRON
[Aside to MOTH] Their eyes, villain, their eyes!
MOTH
That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!--Out--
BOYET
True; out indeed.
MOTH
Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe
Not to behold--
BIRON
[Aside to MOTH] Once to behold, rogue.
MOTH
Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,
--with your sun-beamed eyes--
BOYET
They will not answer to that epithet;
You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'
MOTH
They do not mark me, and that brings me out.
BIRON
