LONGAVILLE
Ay me, I am forsworn!
BIRON
Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers.
FERDINAND
In love, I hope: sweet fellowship in shame!
BIRON
One drunkard loves another of the name.
LONGAVILLE
Am I the first that have been perjured so?
BIRON
I could put thee in comfort. Not by two that I know:
Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society,
The shape of Love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity.
LONGAVILLE
I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move:
O sweet Maria, empress of my love!
These numbers will I tear, and write in prose.
BIRON
O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:
Disfigure not his slop.
LONGAVILLE
This same shall go.
Reads

Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,
'Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,
Persuade my heart to this false perjury?
Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.
A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:
My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;
Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.
Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
Then thou, fair sun, which on my earth dost shine,
Exhalest this vapour-vow; in thee it is:
If broken then, it is no fault of mine:
If by me broke, what fool is not so wise
To lose an oath to win a paradise?
BIRON
This is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity,
A green goose a goddess: pure, pure idolatry.
God amend us, God amend! we are much out o' the way.
LONGAVILLE
By whom shall I send this?--Company! stay.
Steps aside

BIRON
All hid, all hid; an old infant play.
