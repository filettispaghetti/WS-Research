FERDINAND
And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
My Lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er:
And go we, lords, to put in practise that
Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.
Exeunt FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN

BIRON
I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,
These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
Sirrah, come on.
COSTARD
I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I was
taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true
girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of
prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and
till then, sit thee down, sorrow!
Exeunt

LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
SCENE II. The same.

Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit
grows melancholy?
MOTH
A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.
MOTH
No, no; O Lord, sir, no.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my
tender juvenal?
MOTH
By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Why tough senior? why tough senior?
MOTH
Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
appertaining to thy young days, which we may
nominate tender.
