To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:
His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,
Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:
His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
All senses to that sense did make their repair,
To feel only looking on fairest of fair:
Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,
As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,
Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd:
His face's own margent did quote such amazes
That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,
An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.
PRINCESS
Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.
BOYET
But to speak that in words which his eye hath
disclosed.
I only have made a mouth of his eye,
By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.
ROSALINE
Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.
MARIA
He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.
ROSALINE
Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is but grim.
BOYET
Do you hear, my mad wenches?
MARIA
No.
BOYET
What then, do you see?
ROSALINE
Ay, our way to be gone.
BOYET
You are too hard for me.
Exeunt
