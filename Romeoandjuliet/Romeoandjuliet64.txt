Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,

Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
As living here and you no use of him.
JULIET

Nurse
And from my soul too;
Or else beshrew them both.
JULIET

To make confession and to be absolved.
Nurse
Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
Exit

Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Which she hath praised him with above compare
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
If all else fail, myself have power to die.
Exit

And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
FRIAR LAURENCE

Uneven is the course, I like it not.
PARIS
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
