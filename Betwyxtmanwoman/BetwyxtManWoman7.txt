For to myssay / ye can not wyn
And ye that hath no grace / goodnes to tell
To holde his peace / is best for hym.
¶Do ye say / of vs the best
Syns we ye kept / When ye were small
For of lytell medlynge / cometh moche rest
And god amende / the worst of vs all.

¶Of this argument / the hole entent
I marked it / effectually
And after I had herde / them at this discent
I presed towardes them / incontynently
But when they sawe me / aproche them to
Lest I wolde repreue / theyr argument
Full fast they fledde / then bothe me fro
That I ne wyst / whyther they went
Wherfore now to iudge / whiche is moost excellent
I admyt it / vnto this reders prudence
Whyther to man or woman / is more conuenyent
The laude to be gyuen / and wordly magnyfycence.
