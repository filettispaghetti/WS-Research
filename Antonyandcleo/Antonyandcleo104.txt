biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes
a very good report o' the worm; but he that will
believe all that they say, shall never be saved by
half that they do: but this is most fallible, the
worm's an odd worm.
CLEOPATRA
Get thee hence; farewell.
Clown
I wish you all joy of the worm.
Setting down his basket

CLEOPATRA
Farewell.
Clown
You must think this, look you, that the worm will
do his kind.
CLEOPATRA
Ay, ay; farewell.
Clown
Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the
keeping of wise people; for, indeed, there is no
goodness in worm.
CLEOPATRA
Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.
Clown
Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is
not worth the feeding.
CLEOPATRA
Will it eat me?
Clown
You must not think I am so simple but I know the
devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a
woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her
not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the
gods great harm in their women; for in every ten
that they make, the devils mar five.
CLEOPATRA
Well, get thee gone; farewell.
Clown
Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm.
Exit

Re-enter IRAS with a robe, crown, & c

CLEOPATRA
Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have
Immortal longings in me: now no more
The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:
Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
Antony call; I see him rouse himself
