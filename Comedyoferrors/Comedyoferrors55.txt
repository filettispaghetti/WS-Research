And so do I; yet did she call me so:
And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
Did call me brother.
To Luciana

What I told you then,
I hope I shall have leisure to make good;
If this be not a dream I see and hear.
ANGELO
That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
I think it be, sir; I deny it not.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
ANGELO
I think I did, sir; I deny it not.
ADRIANA
I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
No, none by me.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
This purse of ducats I received from you,
And Dromio, my man, did bring them me.
I see we still did meet each other's man,
And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,
And thereupon these errors are arose.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
These ducats pawn I for my father here.
DUKE SOLINUS
It shall not need; thy father hath his life.
Courtezan
Sir, I must have that diamond from you.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.
AEMELIA
Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
To go with us into the abbey here
And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes:
And all that are assembled in this place,
That by this sympathized one day's error
Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,
And we shall make full satisfaction.
Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
Of you, my sons; and till this present hour
