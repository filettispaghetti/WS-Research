OF EPHESUS
Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.
ANGELO
Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
Either send the chain or send me by some token.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,
where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it.
Second Merchant
My business cannot brook this dalliance.
Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no:
If not, I'll leave him to the officer.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
I answer you! what should I answer you?
ANGELO
The money that you owe me for the chain.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
I owe you none till I receive the chain.
ANGELO
You know I gave it you half an hour since.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.
ANGELO
You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:
Consider how it stands upon my credit.
Second Merchant
Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.
Officer
I do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me.
ANGELO
This touches me in reputation.
Either consent to pay this sum for me
Or I attach you by this officer.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
Consent to pay thee that I never had!
Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.
ANGELO
Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer,
I would not spare my brother in this case,
If he should scorn me so apparently.
Officer
I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
