John 10:20	And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?
John 10:21	Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?
John 10:22	And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.
John 10:23	And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.
John 10:24	Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.
John 10:25	Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.
John 10:26	But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.
John 10:27	My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
John 10:28	And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
John 10:29	My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.
John 10:30	I and my Father are one.
John 10:31	Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
John 10:32	Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
John 10:33	The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.
John 10:34	Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?
John 10:35	If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;
John 10:36	Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?
John 10:37	If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
John 10:38	But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.
John 10:39	Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,
John 10:40	And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.
John 10:41	And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.
John 10:42	And many believed on him there.
John 11:1	Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.
John 11:2	(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
John 11:3	Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
John 11:4	When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.
John 11:5	Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
John 11:6	When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.
John 11:7	Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.
John 11:8	His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?
John 11:9	Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.
John 11:10	But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.
John 11:11	These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.
John 11:12	Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.
John 11:13	Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
John 11:14	Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
John 11:15	And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.
John 11:16	Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
John 11:17	Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.
John 11:18	Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:
John 11:19	And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
John 11:20	Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.
John 11:21	Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
John 11:22	But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.
John 11:23	Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
John 11:24	Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
John 11:25	Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
John 11:26	And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?
John 11:27	She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.
