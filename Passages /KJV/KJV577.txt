1 Corinthians 15:33	Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.
1 Corinthians 15:34	Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.
1 Corinthians 15:35	But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
1 Corinthians 15:36	Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:
1 Corinthians 15:37	And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:
1 Corinthians 15:38	But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.
1 Corinthians 15:39	All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.
1 Corinthians 15:40	There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.
1 Corinthians 15:41	There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.
1 Corinthians 15:42	So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
1 Corinthians 15:43	It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
1 Corinthians 15:44	It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
1 Corinthians 15:45	And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.
1 Corinthians 15:46	Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.
1 Corinthians 15:47	The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.
1 Corinthians 15:48	As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
1 Corinthians 15:49	And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
1 Corinthians 15:50	Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
1 Corinthians 15:51	Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
1 Corinthians 15:52	In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
1 Corinthians 15:53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
1 Corinthians 15:54	So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
1 Corinthians 15:55	O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?
1 Corinthians 15:56	The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
1 Corinthians 15:57	But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians 15:58	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
1 Corinthians 16:1	Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.
1 Corinthians 16:2	Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.
1 Corinthians 16:3	And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.
1 Corinthians 16:4	And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.
1 Corinthians 16:5	Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.
1 Corinthians 16:6	And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.
1 Corinthians 16:7	For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.
1 Corinthians 16:8	But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.
1 Corinthians 16:9	For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.
1 Corinthians 16:10	Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.
1 Corinthians 16:11	Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.
1 Corinthians 16:12	As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.
1 Corinthians 16:13	Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.
1 Corinthians 16:14	Let all your things be done with charity.
1 Corinthians 16:15	I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)
1 Corinthians 16:16	That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth.
1 Corinthians 16:17	I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.
1 Corinthians 16:18	For they have refreshed my spirit and your's: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.
1 Corinthians 16:19	The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.
1 Corinthians 16:20	All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.
1 Corinthians 16:21	The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.
1 Corinthians 16:22	If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.
1 Corinthians 16:23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
1 Corinthians 16:24	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
