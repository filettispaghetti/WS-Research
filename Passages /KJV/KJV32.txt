Genesis 50:19	And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?
Genesis 50:20	But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.

Exodus 1:13	And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor:

Exodus 1:18	And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?
