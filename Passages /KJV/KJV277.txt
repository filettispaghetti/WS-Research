Job 36:15	He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.
Job 36:16	Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.
Job 36:17	But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.

Job 36:20	Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
Job 36:21	Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
Job 36:22	Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?
Job 36:23	Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?
Job 36:24	Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.
Job 36:25	Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.
Job 36:26	Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.
Job 36:27	For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:
Job 36:28	Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.
Job 36:29	Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?
Job 36:30	Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.
Job 36:31	For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.
Job 36:32	With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.
Job 36:33	The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.
Job 37:1	At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.
Job 37:2	Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.
Job 37:3	He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.
Job 37:4	After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.
Job 37:5	God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.
Job 37:6	For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.
Job 37:7	He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.
Job 37:8	Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.
Job 37:9	Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.
Job 37:10	By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.
Job 37:11	Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:
Job 37:12	And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.
Job 37:13	He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.
Job 37:14	Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
Job 37:15	Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?
Job 37:16	Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?
Job 37:17	How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?
Job 37:18	Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?
Job 37:19	Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.
Job 37:20	Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.
Job 37:21	And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.
Job 37:22	Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.
Job 37:23	Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.
Job 37:24	Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.
Job 38:1	Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
Job 38:2	Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?
Job 38:3	Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.
Job 38:4	Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.
Job 38:5	Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?
Job 38:6	Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;
Job 38:7	When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
