Luke 21:26	Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.
Luke 21:27	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.

Luke 21:38	And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.
Luke 22:1	Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.
Luke 22:2	And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.
Luke 22:3	Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
Luke 22:4	And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.

Luke 22:12	And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.
Luke 22:13	And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
Luke 22:14	And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.
Luke 22:15	And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:
Luke 22:16	For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
Luke 22:17	And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:

Luke 22:20	Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.
Luke 22:21	But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.
Luke 22:22	And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!
Luke 22:23	And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.
Luke 22:24	And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.
Luke 22:25	And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.
Luke 22:26	But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.
