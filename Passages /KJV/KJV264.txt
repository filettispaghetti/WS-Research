Job 10:15	If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;
Job 10:16	For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.
Job 10:17	Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.
Job 10:18	Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!
Job 10:19	I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
Job 10:20	Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,
Job 10:21	Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;
Job 10:22	A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.
Job 11:1	Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
Job 11:2	Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?
Job 11:3	Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
Job 11:4	For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.
Job 11:5	But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;
Job 11:6	And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.
Job 11:7	Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?
Job 11:8	It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?
Job 11:9	The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.
Job 11:10	If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?
Job 11:11	For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?
Job 11:12	For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt.
Job 11:13	If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;
Job 11:14	If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.
Job 11:15	For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:
Job 11:16	Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:
Job 11:17	And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.
Job 11:18	And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.
Job 11:19	Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.
Job 11:20	But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.
Job 12:1	And Job answered and said,
Job 12:2	No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.
Job 12:3	But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?
Job 12:4	I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.
Job 12:5	He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.
Job 12:6	The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.
Job 12:7	But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:
Job 12:8	Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.
Job 12:9	Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?
Job 12:10	In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.
Job 12:11	Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?
Job 12:12	With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.
Job 12:13	With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.
Job 12:14	Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.
Job 12:15	Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.
Job 12:16	With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.
Job 12:17	He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.
Job 12:18	He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.
Job 12:19	He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.
Job 12:20	He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.
Job 12:21	He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.
Job 12:22	He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.
