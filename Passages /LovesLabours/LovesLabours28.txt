Until the goose came out of door,
And stay'd the odds by adding four.
Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with
my l'envoy.
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
Were still at odds, being but three.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Until the goose came out of door,
Staying the odds by adding four.
MOTH
A good l'envoy, ending in the goose: would you
desire more?
COSTARD
The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.
To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose:
Let me see; a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?
MOTH
By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
Then call'd you for the l'envoy.
COSTARD
True, and I for a plantain: thus came your
argument in;
Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;
And he ended the market.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a shin?
MOTH
I will tell you sensibly.
COSTARD
Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth: I will speak that l'envoy:
I Costard, running out, that was safely within,
Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
We will talk no more of this matter.
COSTARD
Till there be more matter in the shin.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.
COSTARD
O, marry me to one Frances: I smell some l'envoy,
some goose, in this.
