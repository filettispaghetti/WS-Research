To her will, sir, or so.
BIRON
You are welcome, sir: adieu.
BOYET
Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.
Exit BIRON

MARIA
That last is Biron, the merry madcap lord:
Not a word with him but a jest.
BOYET
And every jest but a word.
PRINCESS
It was well done of you to take him at his word.
BOYET
I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.
MARIA
Two hot sheeps, marry.
BOYET
And wherefore not ships?
No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.
MARIA
You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?
BOYET
So you grant pasture for me.
Offering to kiss her

MARIA
Not so, gentle beast:
My lips are no common, though several they be.
BOYET
Belonging to whom?
MARIA
To my fortunes and me.
PRINCESS
Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles, agree:
This civil war of wits were much better used
On Navarre and his book-men; for here 'tis abused.
BOYET
If my observation, which very seldom lies,
By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,
Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.
PRINCESS
With what?
BOYET
With that which we lovers entitle affected.
PRINCESS
Your reason?
BOYET
Why, all his behaviors did make their retire
