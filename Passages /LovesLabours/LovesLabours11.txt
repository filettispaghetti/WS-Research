MOTH
And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your
old time, which we may name tough.
DON ADRIANO DE
ARMADO
Pretty and apt.
MOTH
How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or
I apt, and my saying pretty?
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Thou pretty, because little.
MOTH
Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
And therefore apt, because quick.
MOTH
Speak you this in my praise, master?
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
In thy condign praise.
MOTH
I will praise an eel with the same praise.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
What, that an eel is ingenious?
MOTH
That an eel is quick.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.
MOTH
I am answered, sir.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
I love not to be crossed.
MOTH
[Aside] He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
I have promised to study three years with the duke.
MOTH
You may do it in an hour, sir.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Impossible.
MOTH
How many is one thrice told?
DON
