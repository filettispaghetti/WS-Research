JAQUENETTA
God bless the king!
FERDINAND
What present hast thou there?
COSTARD
Some certain treason.
FERDINAND
What makes treason here?
COSTARD
Nay, it makes nothing, sir.
FERDINAND
If it mar nothing neither,
The treason and you go in peace away together.
JAQUENETTA
I beseech your grace, let this letter be read:
Our parson misdoubts it; 'twas treason, he said.
FERDINAND
Biron, read it over.
Giving him the paper

Where hadst thou it?
JAQUENETTA
Of Costard.
FERDINAND
Where hadst thou it?
COSTARD
Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio.
BIRON tears the letter

FERDINAND
How now! what is in you? why dost thou tear it?
BIRON
A toy, my liege, a toy: your grace needs not fear it.
LONGAVILLE
It did move him to passion, and therefore let's hear it.
DUMAIN
It is Biron's writing, and here is his name.
Gathering up the pieces

BIRON
[To COSTARD] Ah, you whoreson loggerhead! you were
born to do me shame.
Guilty, my lord, guilty! I confess, I confess.
FERDINAND
What?
BIRON
That you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess:
He, he, and you, and you, my liege, and I,
Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die.
