The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,
Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
Must needs appear offence.
Enter ISABELLA

How now, fair maid?
ISABELLA
I am come to know your pleasure.
ANGELO
That you might know it, would much better please me
Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.
ISABELLA
Even so. Heaven keep your honour!
ANGELO
Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,
As long as you or I
yet he must die.
ISABELLA
Under your sentence?
ANGELO
Yea.
ISABELLA
When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,
Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
That his soul sicken not.
ANGELO
Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
A man already made, as to remit
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy
Falsely to take away a life true made
As to put metal in restrained means
To make a false one.
ISABELLA
'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
ANGELO
Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.
Which had you rather, that the most just law
Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,
Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
As she that he hath stain'd?
ISABELLA
Sir, believe this,
I had rather give my body than my soul.
ANGELO
I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins
Stand more for number than for accompt.
ISABELLA
