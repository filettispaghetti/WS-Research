Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your
knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.
LUCIO
Sir, I know him, and I love him.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with
dearer love.
LUCIO
Come, sir, I know what I know.
DUKE VINCENTIO
I can hardly believe that, since you know not what
you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our
prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your
answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,
you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call
upon you; and, I pray you, your name?
LUCIO
Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.
DUKE VINCENTIO
He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to
report you.
LUCIO
I fear you not.
DUKE VINCENTIO
O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you
imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I
can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.
LUCIO
I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,
friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if
Claudio die to-morrow or no?
DUKE VINCENTIO
Why should he die, sir?
LUCIO
Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would
the duke we talk of were returned again: the
ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
continency; sparrows must not build in his
house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke
yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would
never bring them to light: would he were returned!
Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.
Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The
duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on
Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,
he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown
bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.
Exit

DUKE VINCENTIO
