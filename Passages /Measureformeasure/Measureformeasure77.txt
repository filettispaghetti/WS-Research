to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him
speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and
with the other confederate companion!
DUKE VINCENTIO
[To Provost] Stay, sir; stay awhile.
ANGELO
What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.
LUCIO
Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you
bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must
you? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!
show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!
Will't not off?
Pulls off the friar's hood, and discovers DUKE VINCENTIO

DUKE VINCENTIO
Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.
First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.
To LUCIO

Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you
Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.
LUCIO
This may prove worse than hanging.
DUKE VINCENTIO
[To ESCALUS] What you have spoke I pardon: sit you down:
We'll borrow place of him.
To ANGELO

Sir, by your leave.
Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,
That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,
Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
And hold no longer out.
ANGELO
O my dread lord,
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
To think I can be undiscernible,
When I perceive your grace, like power divine,
Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,
No longer session hold upon my shame,
But let my trial be mine own confession:
Immediate sentence then and sequent death
Is all the grace I beg.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Come hither, Mariana.
Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?
ANGELO
I was, my lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO
