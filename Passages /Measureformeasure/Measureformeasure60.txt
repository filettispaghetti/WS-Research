What, ho, Barnardine!
BARNARDINE
[Within] A pox o' your throats! Who makes that
noise there? What are you?
POMPEY
Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so
good, sir, to rise and be put to death.
BARNARDINE
[Within] Away, you rogue, away! I am sleepy.
ABHORSON
Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.
POMPEY
Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are
executed, and sleep afterwards.
ABHORSON
Go in to him, and fetch him out.
POMPEY
He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.
ABHORSON
Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?
POMPEY
Very ready, sir.
Enter BARNARDINE

BARNARDINE
How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?
ABHORSON
Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your
prayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.
BARNARDINE
You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not
fitted for 't.
POMPEY
O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,
and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the
sounder all the next day.
ABHORSON
Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do
we jest now, think you?
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before

DUKE VINCENTIO
Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily
you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort
you and pray with you.
BARNARDINE
Friar, not I	I have been drinking hard all night,
and I will have more time to prepare me, or they
shall beat out my brains with billets: I will not
consent to die this day, that's certain.
