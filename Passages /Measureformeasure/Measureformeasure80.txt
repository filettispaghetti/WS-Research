ISABELLA
Most bounteous sir,
Kneeling

Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
As if my brother lived: I partly think
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
Till he did look on me: since it is so,
Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
In that he did the thing for which he died:
For Angelo,
His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
And must be buried but as an intent
That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;
Intents but merely thoughts.
MARIANA
Merely, my lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
I have bethought me of another fault.
Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
At an unusual hour?
Provost
It was commanded so.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Had you a special warrant for the deed?
Provost
No, my good lord; it was by private message.
DUKE VINCENTIO
For which I do discharge you of your office:
Give up your keys.
Provost
Pardon me, noble lord:
I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;
Yet did repent me, after more advice;
For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
That should by private order else have died,
I have reserved alive.
DUKE VINCENTIO
What's he?
Provost
His name is Barnardine.
DUKE VINCENTIO
I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.
Exit Provost

ESCALUS
I am sorry, one so learned and so wise
As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
