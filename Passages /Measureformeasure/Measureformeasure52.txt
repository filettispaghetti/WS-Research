I have not yet made known to Mariana
A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!
Re-enter MARIANA

I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;
She comes to do you good.
ISABELLA
I do desire the like.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?
MARIANA
Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Take, then, this your companion by the hand,
Who hath a story ready for your ear.
I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;
The vaporous night approaches.
MARIANA
Will't please you walk aside?
Exeunt MARIANA and ISABELLA

DUKE VINCENTIO
O place and greatness! millions of false eyes
Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report
Run with these false and most contrarious quests
Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit
Make thee the father of their idle dreams
And rack thee in their fancies.
Re-enter MARIANA and ISABELLA

Welcome, how agreed?
ISABELLA
She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,
If you advise it.
DUKE VINCENTIO
It is not my consent,
But my entreaty too.
ISABELLA
Little have you to say
When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
'Remember now my brother.'
MARIANA
Fear me not.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
He is your husband on a pre-contract:
To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,
Sith that the justice of your title to him
Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:
Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.
