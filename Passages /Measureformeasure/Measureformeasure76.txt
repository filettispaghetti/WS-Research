And in the witness of his proper ear,
To call him villain? and then to glance from him
To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you
Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
What 'unjust'!
DUKE VINCENTIO
Be not so hot; the duke
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,
Nor here provincial. My business in this state
Made me a looker on here in Vienna,
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,
But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
As much in mock as mark.
ESCALUS
Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!
ANGELO
What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
Is this the man that you did tell us of?
LUCIO
'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate:
do you know me?
DUKE VINCENTIO
I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I
met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.
LUCIO
O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?
DUKE VINCENTIO
Most notedly, sir.
LUCIO
Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a
fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?
DUKE VINCENTIO
You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make
that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and
much more, much worse.
LUCIO
O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the
nose for thy speeches?
DUKE VINCENTIO
I protest I love the duke as I love myself.
ANGELO
Hark, how the villain would close now, after his
treasonable abuses!
ESCALUS
Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with
him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him
