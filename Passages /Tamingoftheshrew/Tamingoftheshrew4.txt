And each one to his office when he wakes.
Some bear out SLY. A trumpet sounds

Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:
Exit Servingman

Belike, some noble gentleman that means,
Travelling some journey, to repose him here.
Re-enter Servingman

How now! who is it?
Servant
An't please your honour, players
That offer service to your lordship.
Lord
Bid them come near.
Enter Players

Now, fellows, you are welcome.
Players
We thank your honour.
Lord
Do you intend to stay with me tonight?
A Player
So please your lordship to accept our duty.
Lord

Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:

I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part
Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.
A Player

Lord
'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.
Well, you are come to me in a happy time;
The rather for I have some sport in hand
Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
There is a lord will hear you play to-night:
But I am doubtful of your modesties;
Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--
For yet his honour never heard a play--
You break into some merry passion
And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
If you should smile he grows impatient.
A Player
Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,
Were he the veriest antic in the world.
Lord
Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
