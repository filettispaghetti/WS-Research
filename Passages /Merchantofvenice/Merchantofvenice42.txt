Yes, faith, my lord.
BASSANIO
Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.
GRATIANO
We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.
NERISSA
What, and stake down?
GRATIANO
No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down.
But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What,
and my old Venetian friend Salerio?
Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a Messenger from Venice

BASSANIO
Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither;
If that the youth of my new interest here
Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,
I bid my very friends and countrymen,
Sweet Portia, welcome.
PORTIA
So do I, my lord:
They are entirely welcome.
LORENZO
I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,
My purpose was not to have seen you here;
But meeting with Salerio by the way,
He did entreat me, past all saying nay,
To come with him along.
SALERIO
I did, my lord;
And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio
Commends him to you.
Gives Bassanio a letter

BASSANIO
Ere I ope his letter,
I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.
SALERIO
Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there
Will show you his estate.
GRATIANO
Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.
Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?
How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?
I know he will be glad of our success;
We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.
SALERIO
I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
PORTIA
