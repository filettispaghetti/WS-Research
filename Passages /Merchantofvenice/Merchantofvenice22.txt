adieu: these foolish drops do something drown my
manly spirit: adieu.
JESSICA
Farewell, good Launcelot.
Exit Launcelot

Alack, what heinous sin is it in me
To be ashamed to be my father's child!
But though I am a daughter to his blood,
I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo,
If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,
Become a Christian and thy loving wife.
Exit

SCENE IV. The same. A street.

Enter GRATIANO, LORENZO, SALARINO, and SALANIO
LORENZO
Nay, we will slink away in supper-time,
Disguise us at my lodging and return,
All in an hour.
GRATIANO
We have not made good preparation.
SALARINO
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.
SALANIO
'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order'd,
And better in my mind not undertook.
LORENZO
'Tis now but four o'clock: we have two hours
To furnish us.
Enter LAUNCELOT, with a letter

Friend Launcelot, what's the news?
LAUNCELOT
An it shall please you to break up
this, it shall seem to signify.
LORENZO
I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand;
And whiter than the paper it writ on
Is the fair hand that writ.
GRATIANO
Love-news, in faith.
LAUNCELOT
By your leave, sir.
LORENZO
Whither goest thou?
LAUNCELOT
Marry, sir, to bid my old master the
Jew to sup to-night with my new master the Christian.
