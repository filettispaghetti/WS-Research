You have of these pedlars, that have more in them
than you'ld think, sister.
PERDITA
Ay, good brother, or go about to think.
Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing

AUTOLYCUS
Lawn as white as driven snow;
Cyprus black as e'er was crow;
Gloves as sweet as damask roses;
Masks for faces and for noses;
Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,
Perfume for a lady's chamber;
Golden quoifs and stomachers,
For my lads to give their dears:
Pins and poking-sticks of steel,
What maids lack from head to heel:
Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;
Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.
Clown
If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take
no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it
will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.
MOPSA
I was promised them against the feast; but they come
not too late now.
DORCAS
He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.
MOPSA
He hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has
paid you more, which will shame you to give him again.
Clown
Is there no manners left among maids? will they
wear their plackets where they should bear their
faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are
going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these
secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all
our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour
your tongues, and not a word more.
MOPSA
I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace
and a pair of sweet gloves.
Clown
Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way
and lost all my money?
AUTOLYCUS
And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;
therefore it behoves men to be wary.
