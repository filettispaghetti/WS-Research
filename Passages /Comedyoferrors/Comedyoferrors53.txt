Though now this grained face of mine be hid
In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
And all the conduits of my blood froze up,
Yet hath my night of life some memory,
My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:
All these old witnesses--I cannot err--
Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
I never saw my father in my life.
AEGEON
But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,
Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,
Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
The duke and all that know me in the city
Can witness with me that it is not so
I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.
DUKE SOLINUS
I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years
Have I been patron to Antipholus,
During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa:
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.
Re-enter AEMILIA, with ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse

AEMELIA
Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd.
All gather to see them

ADRIANA
I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.
DUKE SOLINUS
One of these men is Genius to the other;
And so of these. Which is the natural man,
And which the spirit? who deciphers them?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I, sir, am Dromio; pray, let me stay.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
AEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
O, my old master! who hath bound him here?
AEMELIA
Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds
And gain a husband by his liberty.
Speak, old AEgeon, if thou be'st the man
