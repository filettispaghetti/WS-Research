That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia
That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:
O, if thou be'st the same AEgeon, speak,
And speak unto the same AEmilia!
AEGEON
If I dream not, thou art AEmilia:
If thou art she, tell me where is that son
That floated with thee on the fatal raft?
AEMELIA
By men of Epidamnum he and I
And the twin Dromio all were taken up;
But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
By force took Dromio and my son from them
And me they left with those of Epidamnum.
What then became of them I cannot tell
I to this fortune that you see me in.
DUKE SOLINUS
Why, here begins his morning story right;
These two Antipholuses, these two so like,
And these two Dromios, one in semblance,--
Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,--
These are the parents to these children,
Which accidentally are met together.
Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.
DUKE SOLINUS
Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
And I with him.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.
ADRIANA
Which of you two did dine with me to-day?
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
I, gentle mistress.
ADRIANA
And are not you my husband?
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
No; I say nay to that.

OF SYRACUSE
