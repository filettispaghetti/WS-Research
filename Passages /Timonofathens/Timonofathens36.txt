Let me pass quietly:
Believe 't, my lord and I have made an end;
I have no more to reckon, he to spend.
Lucilius' Servant	Ay, but this answer will not serve.
FLAVIUS
If 'twill not serve,'tis not so base as you;
For you serve knaves.
Exit

Varro's
First Servant
How! what does his cashiered worship mutter?
Varro's
Second Servant
No matter what; he's poor, and that's revenge
enough. Who can speak broader than he that has no
house to put his head in? such may rail against
great buildings.
Enter SERVILIUS

TITUS
O, here's Servilius; now we shall know some answer.
SERVILIUS
If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some
other hour, I should derive much from't; for,
take't of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to
discontent: his comfortable temper has forsook him;
he's much out of health, and keeps his chamber.
Lucilius' Servant: Many do keep their chambers are not sick:
And, if it be so far beyond his health,
Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,
And make a clear way to the gods.
SERVILIUS
Good gods!
TITUS
We cannot take this for answer, sir.
FLAMINIUS
[Within] Servilius, help! My lord! my lord!
Enter TIMON, in a rage, FLAMINIUS following

TIMON
What, are my doors opposed against my passage?
Have I been ever free, and must my house
Be my retentive enemy, my gaol?
The place which I have feasted, does it now,
Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?
Lucilius' Servant	Put in now, Titus.
TITUS
My lord, here is my bill.
Lucilius' Servant	Here's mine.
