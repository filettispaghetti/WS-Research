E'en so thou outrunnest grace. Fool, I will go with
you to Lord Timon's.
Fool
Will you leave me there?
APEMANTUS
If Timon stay at home. You three serve three usurers?
All Servants
Ay; would they served us!
APEMANTUS
So would I,--as good a trick as ever hangman served thief.
Fool
Are you three usurers' men?
All Servants
Ay, fool.
Fool
I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant: my
mistress is one, and I am her fool. When men come
to borrow of your masters, they approach sadly, and
go away merry; but they enter my mistress' house
merrily, and go away sadly: the reason of this?
Varro's Servant	I could render one.
APEMANTUS
Do it then, that we may account thee a whoremaster
and a knave; which not-withstanding, thou shalt be
no less esteemed.
Varro's Servant	What is a whoremaster, fool?
Fool
A fool in good clothes, and something like thee.
'Tis a spirit: sometime't appears like a lord;
sometime like a lawyer; sometime like a philosopher,
with two stones moe than's artificial one: he is
very often like a knight; and, generally, in all
shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore
to thirteen, this spirit walks in.
Varro's Servant	Thou art not altogether a fool.
Fool
Nor thou altogether a wise man: as much foolery as
I have, so much wit thou lackest.
APEMANTUS
That answer might have become Apemantus.
All Servants
Aside, aside; here comes Lord Timon.
Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS

APEMANTUS
Come with me, fool, come.
Fool
I do not always follow lover, elder brother and
woman; sometime the philosopher.
Exeunt APEMANTUS and Fool
