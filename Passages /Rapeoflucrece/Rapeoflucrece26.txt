And merry fools to mock at him resort.
Let him have time to mark how slow time goes
In time of sorrow, and how swift and short
His time of folly and his time of sport;
  And ever let his unrecalling crime
  Have time to wail th'abusing of his time.

"O Time, thou tutor both to good and bad,
Teach me to curse him that thou taught'st this ill!
At his own shadow let the thief run mad,
Himself himself seek every hour to kill.
Such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill,
  For who so base would such an office have

"In vain I rail at Opportunity,
At Time, at Tarquin, and uncheerful Night.
In vain I cavil with mine infamy.
In vain I spurn at my confirmed despite.
This helpless smoke of words doth me no right.
  The remedy indeed to do me good
  Is to let forth my foul defiled blood.

"Poor hand, why quiver'st thou at this decree?
Honor thyself to rid me of this shame,
For if I die, my honor lives in thee,
