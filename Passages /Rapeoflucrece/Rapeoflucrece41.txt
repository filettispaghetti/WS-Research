
"Mine enemy was strong, my poor self weak,
And far the weaker with so strong a fear.
My bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak;
No rightful plea might plead for justice there.
His scarlet lust came evidence to swear
  That my poor beauty had purloined his eyes,
  And when the judge is robbed, the prisoner dies.

"O, teach me how to make mine own excuse,
Or, at the least, this refuge let me find:
Though my gross blood be stained with this abuse,
Immaculate and spotless is my mind;
That was not forced, that never was inclined
  To accessory yieldings, but still pure
  Doth in her poisoned closet yet endure."

Lo, here the hopeless merchant of this loss,
With head declined and voice dammed up with woe,
With sad set eyes and wreathed arms across,
From lips new-waxen pale begins to blow
The grief away that stops his answer so.
  But, wretched as he is, he strives in vain;
  What he breathes out his breath drinks up again.

As through an arch the violent roaring tide
Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste,
Yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride
Back to the strait that forced him on so fast--
In rage sent out, recalled in rage, being past--
  Even so his sighs, his sorrows, make a saw
  To push grief on, and back the same grief draw,

Which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth,
And his untimely frenzy thus awaketh:
"Dear lord, thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth
Another power; no flood by raining slaketh.
My woe too sensible thy passion maketh
  More feeling-painful. Let it then suffice
  To drown one woe, one pair of weeping eyes.

"And for my sake when I might charm thee so,
For she that was thy Lucrece, now attend me:
Be suddenly revenged on my foe,
Thine, mine, his own. Suppose thou dost defend me
From what is past. The help that thou shalt lend me
  Comes all too late, yet let the traitor die,
  For sparing justice feeds iniquity.

"But ere I name him, you fair lords," quoth she,
