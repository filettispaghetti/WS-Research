sped to-day. You'll remember your brother's excuse?
PARIS
To a hair.
PANDARUS
Farewell, sweet queen.
HELEN
Commend me to your niece.
PANDARUS
I will, sweet queen.
Exit

A retreat sounded

PARIS
They're come from field: let us to Priam's hall,
To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you
To help unarm our Hector: his stubborn buckles,
With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,
Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
Or force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more
Than all the island kings,--disarm great Hector.
HELEN
'Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris;
Yea, what he shall receive of us in duty
Gives us more palm in beauty than we have,
Yea, overshines ourself.
PARIS
Sweet, above thought I love thee.
Exeunt
