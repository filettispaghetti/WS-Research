The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves
Give him allowance for the better man;
For that will physic the great Myrmidon
Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall
His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.
If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,
We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,
Yet go we under our opinion still
That we have better men. But, hit or miss,
Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:
Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.
NESTOR
Ulysses,
Now I begin to relish thy advice;
And I will give a taste of it forthwith
To Agamemnon: go we to him straight.
Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone
Must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone.
Exeunt

ACT II

SCENE I. A part of the Grecian camp.

Enter AJAX and THERSITES
AJAX
Thersites!
THERSITES
Agamemnon, how if he had boils? full, all over,
generally?
AJAX
Thersites!
THERSITES
And those boils did run? say so: did not the
general run then? were not that a botchy core?
AJAX
Dog!
THERSITES
Then would come some matter from him; I see none now.
AJAX
Thou bitch-wolf's son, canst thou not hear?
Beating him

Feel, then.
THERSITES
The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel
beef-witted lord!
AJAX
Speak then, thou vinewedst leaven, speak: I will
beat thee into handsomeness.
