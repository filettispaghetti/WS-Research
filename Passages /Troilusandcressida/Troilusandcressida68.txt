From Troy and Troilus.
CRESSIDA
Is it possible?
TROILUS
And suddenly; where injury of chance
Puts back leave-taking, justles roughly by
All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips
Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents
Our lock'd embrasures, strangles our dear vows
Even in the birth of our own labouring breath:
We two, that with so many thousand sighs
Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves
With the rude brevity and discharge of one.
Injurious time now with a robber's haste
Crams his rich thievery up, he knows not how:
As many farewells as be stars in heaven,
With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them,
He fumbles up into a lose adieu,
And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,
Distasted with the salt of broken tears.
AENEAS
[Within] My lord, is the lady ready?
TROILUS
Hark! you are call'd: some say the Genius so
Cries 'come' to him that instantly must die.
Bid them have patience; she shall come anon.
PANDARUS
Where are my tears? rain, to lay this wind, or
my heart will be blown up by the root.
Exit

CRESSIDA
I must then to the Grecians?
TROILUS
No remedy.
CRESSIDA
A woful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!
When shall we see again?
TROILUS
Hear me, my love: be thou but true of heart,--
CRESSIDA
I true! how now! what wicked deem is this?
TROILUS
Nay, we must use expostulation kindly,
For it is parting from us:
I speak not 'be thou true,' as fearing thee,
For I will throw my glove to Death himself,
That there's no maculation in thy heart:
But 'be thou true,' say I, to fashion in
My sequent protestation; be thou true,
