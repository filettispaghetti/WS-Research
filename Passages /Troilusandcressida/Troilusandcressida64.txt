PANDARUS
Ha! ha! Alas, poor wretch! ah, poor capocchia!
hast not slept to-night? would he not, a naughty
man, let it sleep? a bugbear take him!
CRESSIDA
Did not I tell you? Would he were knock'd i' the head!
Knocking within

Who's that at door? good uncle, go and see.
My lord, come you again into my chamber:
You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.
TROILUS
Ha, ha!
CRESSIDA
Come, you are deceived, I think of no such thing.
Knocking within

How earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in:
I would not for half Troy have you seen here.
Exeunt TROILUS and CRESSIDA

PANDARUS
Who's there? what's the matter? will you beat
down the door? How now! what's the matter?
Enter AENEAS

AENEAS
Good morrow, lord, good morrow.
PANDARUS
Who's there? my Lord AEneas! By my troth,
I knew you not: what news with you so early?
AENEAS
Is not Prince Troilus here?
PANDARUS
Here! what should he do here?
AENEAS
Come, he is here, my lord; do not deny him:
It doth import him much to speak with me.
PANDARUS
Is he here, say you? 'tis more than I know, I'll
be sworn: for my own part, I came in late. What
should he do here?
AENEAS
Who!--nay, then: come, come, you'll do him wrong
ere you're ware: you'll be so true to him, to be
false to him: do not you know of him, but yet go
fetch him hither; go.
Re-enter TROILUS
