I'll let his humours blood.
AGAMEMNON
He will be the physician that should be the patient.
AJAX
An all men were o' my mind,--
ULYSSES
Wit would be out of fashion.
AJAX
A' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords first:
shall pride carry it?
NESTOR
An 'twould, you'ld carry half.
ULYSSES
A' would have ten shares.
AJAX

NESTOR

Here is a man--but 'tis before his face;

NESTOR
Wherefore should you so?
He is not emulous, as Achilles is.
ULYSSES

AJAX
A whoreson dog, that shall pelter thus with us!

NESTOR
What a vice were it in Ajax now,--
ULYSSES
If he were proud,--
DIOMEDES
Or covetous of praise,--
ULYSSES
Ay, or surly borne,--
DIOMEDES
Or strange, or self-affected!
ULYSSES
Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure;
Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck:
