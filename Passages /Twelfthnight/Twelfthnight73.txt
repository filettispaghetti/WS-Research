letter to you; I should have given't you to-day
morning, but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,
so it skills not much when they are delivered.
OLIVIA
Open't, and read it.
Clown
Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers
the madman.
Reads

'By the Lord, madam,'--
OLIVIA
How now! art thou mad?
Clown
No, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship
will have it as it ought to be, you must allow Vox.
OLIVIA
Prithee, read i' thy right wits.
Clown
So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is to
read thus: therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.
OLIVIA
Read it you, sirrah.
To FABIAN

FABIAN
[Reads] 'By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the
world shall know it: though you have put me into
darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over
me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as
your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced
me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt
not but to do myself much right, or you much shame.
Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little
unthought of and speak out of my injury.
THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO.'
OLIVIA
Did he write this?
Clown
Ay, madam.
DUKE ORSINO
This savours not much of distraction.
OLIVIA
See him deliver'd, Fabian; bring him hither.
Exit FABIAN

My lord so please you, these things further
thought on,
To think me as well a sister as a wife,
One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you,
