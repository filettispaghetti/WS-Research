I think not so, my lord.
DUKE ORSINO
Dear lad, believe it;
For they shall yet belie thy happy years,
That say thou art a man: Diana's lip
Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe
Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,
And all is semblative a woman's part.
I know thy constellation is right apt
For this affair. Some four or five attend him;
All, if you will; for I myself am best
When least in company. Prosper well in this,
And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
To call his fortunes thine.
VIOLA
I'll do my best
To woo your lady:
Aside

yet, a barful strife!
Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.
Exeunt

SCENE V. OLIVIA'S house.

Enter MARIA and Clown
MARIA
Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will
not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in
way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.
Clown
Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this
world needs to fear no colours.
MARIA
Make that good.
Clown
He shall see none to fear.
MARIA
A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that
saying was born, of 'I fear no colours.'
Clown
Where, good Mistress Mary?
MARIA
In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.
Clown
Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those
that are fools, let them use their talents.
MARIA
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or,
to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?
