Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.
PROTEUS
And what says she to my little jewel?
LAUNCE
Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you
currish thanks is good enough for such a present.
PROTEUS
But she received my dog?
LAUNCE
No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought him
back again.
PROTEUS
What, didst thou offer her this from me?
LAUNCE
Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me by
the hangman boys in the market-place: and then I
offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of
yours, and therefore the gift the greater.
PROTEUS
Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,
Or ne'er return again into my sight.
Away, I say! stay'st thou to vex me here?
Exit LAUNCE

A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!
Sebastian, I have entertained thee,
Partly that I have need of such a youth
That can with some discretion do my business,
For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,
But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,
Which, if my augury deceive me not,
Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth:
Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.
Go presently and take this ring with thee,
Deliver it to Madam Silvia:
She loved me well deliver'd it to me.
JULIA
It seems you loved not her, to leave her token.
She is dead, belike?
PROTEUS
Not so; I think she lives.
JULIA
Alas!
PROTEUS
Why dost thou cry 'alas'?
JULIA
I cannot choose
But pity her.
PROTEUS
Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
