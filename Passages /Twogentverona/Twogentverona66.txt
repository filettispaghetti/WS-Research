to Madam Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done.
PROTEUS
Where is that ring, boy?
JULIA
Here 'tis; this is it.
PROTEUS
How! let me see:
Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.
JULIA
O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
This is the ring you sent to Silvia.
PROTEUS
But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart
I gave this unto Julia.
JULIA
And Julia herself did give it me;
And Julia herself hath brought it hither.
PROTEUS
How! Julia!
JULIA
Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.
How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!
Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me
Such an immodest raiment, if shame live
In a disguise of love:
It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
Women to change their shapes than men their minds.
PROTEUS
Than men their minds! 'tis true.
O heaven! were man
But constant, he were perfect. That one error
Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:
Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy
More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?
VALENTINE
Come, come, a hand from either:
Let me be blest to make this happy close;
'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.
PROTEUS
Bear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever.
JULIA
And I mine.
Enter Outlaws, with DUKE and THURIO

Outlaws
A prize, a prize, a prize!
VALENTINE
