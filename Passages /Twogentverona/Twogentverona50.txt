JULIA
But shall I hear him speak?
Host
Ay, that you shall.
JULIA
That will be music.
Music plays

Host
Hark, hark!
JULIA
Is he among these?
Host
Ay: but, peace! let's hear 'em.
SONG.
Who is Silvia? what is she,
That all our swains commend her?
Holy, fair and wise is she;
The heaven such grace did lend her,
That she might admired be.
Is she kind as she is fair?
For beauty lives with kindness.
Love doth to her eyes repair,
To help him of his blindness,
And, being help'd, inhabits there.
Then to Silvia let us sing,
That Silvia is excelling;
She excels each mortal thing
Upon the dull earth dwelling:
To her let us garlands bring.
Host
How now! are you sadder than you were before? How
do you, man? the music likes you not.
JULIA
You mistake; the musician likes me not.
Host
Why, my pretty youth?
JULIA
He plays false, father.
Host
How? out of tune on the strings?
JULIA
Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my very
heart-strings.
Host
You have a quick ear.
JULIA
Ay, I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow heart.
Host
I perceive you delight not in music.
