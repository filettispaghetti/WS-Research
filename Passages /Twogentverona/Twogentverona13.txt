What maintenance he from his friends receives,
Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.
To-morrow be in readiness to go:
Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.
PROTEUS
My lord, I cannot be so soon provided:
Please you, deliberate a day or two.
ANTONIO
Look, what thou want'st shall be sent after thee:
No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.
Come on, Panthino: you shall be employ'd
To hasten on his expedition.
Exeunt ANTONIO and PANTHINO

PROTEUS
Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,
And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.
I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,
Lest he should take exceptions to my love;
And with the vantage of mine own excuse
Hath he excepted most against my love.
O, how this spring of love resembleth
The uncertain glory of an April day,
Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
And by and by a cloud takes all away!
Re-enter PANTHINO

PANTHINO
Sir Proteus, your father calls for you:
He is in haste; therefore, I pray you to go.
PROTEUS
Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto,
And yet a thousand times it answers 'no.'
Exeunt

ACT II

SCENE I. Milan. The DUKE's palace.

Enter VALENTINE and SPEED
SPEED
Sir, your glove.
VALENTINE
Not mine; my gloves are on.
SPEED
Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.
VALENTINE
Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine:
Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
Ah, Silvia, Silvia!
