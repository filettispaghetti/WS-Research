Here comes the duke.
Enter DUKE

DUKE
How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!
Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?
THURIO
Not I.
PROTEUS
Nor I.
DUKE
Saw you my daughter?
PROTEUS
Neither.
DUKE
Why then,
She's fled unto that peasant Valentine;
And Eglamour is in her company.
'Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,
As he in penance wander'd through the forest;
Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,
But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it;
Besides, she did intend confession
At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not;
These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,
But mount you presently and meet with me
Upon the rising of the mountain-foot
That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled:
Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.
Exit

THURIO
Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,
That flies her fortune when it follows her.
I'll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour
Than for the love of reckless Silvia.
Exit

PROTEUS
And I will follow, more for Silvia's love
Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.
Exit

JULIA
And I will follow, more to cross that love
Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love.
Exit

SCENE III. The frontiers of Mantua. The forest.
