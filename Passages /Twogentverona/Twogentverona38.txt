But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.
Enter PROTEUS and LAUNCE

PROTEUS
Run, boy, run, run, and seek him out.
LAUNCE
Soho, soho!
PROTEUS
What seest thou?
LAUNCE
Him we go to find: there's not a hair on's head
but 'tis a Valentine.
PROTEUS
Valentine?
VALENTINE
No.
PROTEUS
Who then? his spirit?
VALENTINE
Neither.
PROTEUS
What then?
VALENTINE
Nothing.
LAUNCE
Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?
PROTEUS
Who wouldst thou strike?
LAUNCE
Nothing.
PROTEUS
Villain, forbear.
LAUNCE
Why, sir, I'll strike nothing: I pray you,--
PROTEUS
Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.
VALENTINE
My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news,
So much of bad already hath possess'd them.
PROTEUS
Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,
For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.
VALENTINE
Is Silvia dead?
PROTEUS
No, Valentine.
VALENTINE
No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.
Hath she forsworn me?
PROTEUS
