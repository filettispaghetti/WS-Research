HOTSPUR
I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.
LADY PERCY
Wouldst thou have thy head broken?
HOTSPUR
No.
LADY PERCY
Then be still.
HOTSPUR
Neither;'tis a woman's fault.
LADY PERCY
Now God help thee!
HOTSPUR
To the Welsh lady's bed.
LADY PERCY
What's that?
HOTSPUR
Peace! she sings.
Here the lady sings a Welsh song

HOTSPUR
Come, Kate, I'll have your song too.
LADY PERCY
Not mine, in good sooth.
HOTSPUR
Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear like a
comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth,' and
'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and
'as sure as day,'
And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,
As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury.
Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,
A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'
And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,
To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.
Come, sing.
LADY PERCY
I will not sing.
HOTSPUR
'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast
teacher. An the indentures be drawn, I'll away
within these two hours; and so, come in when ye will.
Exit

GLENDOWER
Come, come, Lord Mortimer; you are as slow
As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.
By this our book is drawn; we'll but seal,
And then to horse immediately.
MORTIMER
