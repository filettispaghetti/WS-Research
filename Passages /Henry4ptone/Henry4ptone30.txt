I am now of all humours that have showed themselves
humours since the old days of goodman Adam to the
pupil age of this present twelve o'clock at midnight.

What's o'clock, Francis?
FRANCIS
Anon, anon, sir.

PRINCE HENRY
That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a
parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is

shotten herring. There live not three good men
unhanged in England; and one of them is fat and
