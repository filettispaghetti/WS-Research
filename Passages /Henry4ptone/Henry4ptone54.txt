Scene III
Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.
Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH

FALSTAFF
Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last
action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my
skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose
gown; I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,
I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some
