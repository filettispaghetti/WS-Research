take the ƒame vnwo°thely: My duetie is to exho°te you in the
meane ƒeaƒon, to conƒider the greatnes of the thing, and to
ƒerche and examine your owne conƒciences, and that not
lyghtly no° after the maner of di±imulers with G O D :
But as they whiche ƒhoulde come to a mo¥e Godly and
heauenly Banket, not to come but in the mariage garment
required of God in ƒcripture, that you may (ƒo muche as
lieth in you) be founde wo°thie to come to ƒuche a table. The
waies and meanes thereto is.
Fir¥, that you be truly repentaunt of your fo°mer euill
life, and that you confe±e with an vnfained hearte to
almightie God, youre ƒynnes and vnkyndnes towardes his
Maie¥ie committed, either by will, wo°de o° dede, infirmitie
o° igno°aunce: and that with inwarde ƒo°owe & teares you
bewaile your offences, & require of almightie God mercie &
pardon, p°omiƒing to him (from the botome of your hartes)
thamendment of your fo°mer lyfe. And emonges all others,
I am commaunded of God, eƒpecially to moue and exho°te
you to reconcile yourƒelfes to your neighbo°s, whom you
haue offended, o° who hath offended you, putting out of
your heartes al hatred and malice again¥ them, and to be in 
loue and charitie with all the wo°lde, and to fo°geue other,
as you woulde that god ƒhould fo°geue you. And yf any
man haue doen w°ong to any other: let him make
ƒatiƒfaccion, and due re¥itucion of all landes & goodes,
w°ongfully taken awaye o° with holden, befo°e he come to
Goddes bo°de, o° at the lea¥ be in ful minde and purpoƒe ƒo to
do, a±one as he is able, o° els let him not come to this holy
table, thinking to deceyue God, who ƒeeth all mennes hartes.
Fo° neither the abƒolucion of the p°ie¥, can any thing auayle
them, no° the receiuyng of this holy ƒacrament doth any
thing but increaƒe their damnacion. And yf there bee any of
you, whoƒe conƒcience is troubled and greued in any thing,
lackyng comfo°te o° counƒaill, let him come to me, o° to ƒome
other dyƒcrete and learned p°ie¥, taught in the law of God,
and confe±e and open his ƒynne & griefe ƒecretly, that he
may receiue ƒuche gho¥ly counƒaill, aduyƒe, and comfo°t,
that his conƒcience maye be releued, and that of vs (as of the
mini¥ers of GOD and of the churche) he may receiue
comfo°t and abƒolucion, to the ƒatiƒfaccion of his mynde, and
auoyding of all ƒcruple and doubtfulnes: requiryng ƒuche as
ƒhalbe ƒatiƒfied with a generall confe±ion, not to be offended
with them that doe vƒe, to their further ƒatiƒfiyng, the
auriculer and ƒecret confe±ion to the P°ie¥: no° thoƒe alƒo
whiche thinke nedefull o° conuenient, fo° the quietnes of
their awne conƒciences, particuliarly to open their ƒinnes to
the P°ie¥: to bee offended with them that are ƒatiƒfied, with
their humble confe±ion to G O D , and the generall confe±ion
to the churche. But in all thinges to folowe and kepe
the rule of charitie, and euery man to be ƒatiƒfied with his
