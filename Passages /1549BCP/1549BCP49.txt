CONFIRMACION
wherin is conteined a Cathe=
chiƒme fo° child°en.
O thende that confirmacion may be mini¥red to the mo°e edifying
of ƒuche as ƒhall receiue it (acco°ding to Saint Paules
doctrine, who teacheth that all thynges ƒhould be doen in the
churche to the edificacion of the ƒame) it is thought good that
none hereafter ƒhall be confirmed, but ƒuche as can ƒay in they° mother tong,
tharticles of the faith the lo°des p°ayer, and the tenne commaundementes;
And can alƒo aunƒwere to ƒuche que¥ions of this ƒho°te Catechiƒme, as the
Bu±hop (o° ƒuche as he ƒhall appoynte) ƒhall by his diƒcrecion appoƒe them in.
And this o°d°e is mo¥ conuenient to be obƒerued fo° diuers conƒideracions.
¶ Fir¥ becauƒe that whan child°en come to the yeres of diƒcrecion and haue
learned what they° Godfathers and Godmothers p°omiƒed fo° them in Baptiƒme,
they may then themƒelfes with their owne mouth, and with they° owne
conƒent, openly befo°e the churche, ratifie and confe±e the ƒame, and alƒo
p°omiƒe that by the grace of God, they will euermo°e endeuour themƒelues
fiathfully to obƒerue and kepe ƒuch thinges, as they by they° owne mouth and
confe±ion haue a±ented vnto.
¶ Secondly, fo° aƒmuch as confirmacion is mini¥red to them that be
Baptiƒed, that by impoƒicion of handes, and p°aier they may receiue ¥rength
and defence again¥ all temptacions to ƒin, and the a±autes of the wo°lde, and
the deuill: it is mo¥ mete to be mini¥red, when child°en come to that age, that
partly by the frayltie of they° owne fleƒhe, partly by the a±autes of the
wo°ld and the deuil, they begin to be in daungier to fall into ƒinne.
¶ Thirdly, fo° that it is agreeable with the vƒage of the churche in tymes
pa¥, wherby it was o°deined, that Confirmacion ƒhould bee mini¥red to them
that were of perfecte age, that they beyng in¥ructed in Ch°i¥es religion,
ƒhould openly p°ofe±e they° owne fayth, and p°omiƒe to be obedient vnto the
will of God.
¶ And that no manne ƒhall thynke that anye detrimente ƒhall come to
child°en by differryng of they° confirmacion: he ƒhall knowe
fo° trueth, that it is certayn by Goddes woo°de,
that child°en beeyng Baptized (if they
departe out of thys lyfe in they°
infancie) are vndoubtedly
ƒaued.
