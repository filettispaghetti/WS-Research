Publyke Baptiƒme.
ƒonne Jeƒus Ch°i¥e, thou dyde¥ ƒanctifie the fludde Jo°dan,
and al other waters to this mi¥icall waƒhing away of

with thy holy go¥, that by this holeƒome lauer of regeneracion,
whatƒoeuer ƒynne is in them, may be waƒhed cleane
away, that they being deliuered from thy wrathe, may be
receiued into tharke of Ch°i¥es churche, and ƒo ƒaued from
peryƒhyng: and beeyng feruente in ƒpirite, ¥edfa¥e in fayth,
ioyfull th°ough hope, rooted in charitie, maye euer ƒerue

holy and choƒen people. This graunte vs we beƒeche the fo°
Jeƒus Ch°i¥es ƒake our Lo°de. Amen.
¶ Here ƒhall the p°ie¥ aƒke what ƒhall be the name of the childe,
and when the Godfathers and Godmothers haue tolde the name,
then ƒhall he make a cro±e vpon the childes fo°ehead and b°e¥e,
ƒaying.
¶ N. Receyue the ƒigne of the holy Cro±e, both in thy
fo°ehead, and in thy b°e¥e, in token that thou ƒhalt not be
aƒhamed to confe±e thy fayth in Ch°i¥e crucifyed, and
manfully to fyght vnder his banner again¥ ƒynne, the
wo°lde, and the deuill, and to continewe his faythfull ƒoldiour
and ƒeruaunt vnto thy lyfes ende. Amen.
And this he ƒhalt doe and ƒaye to as many child°en as bee p°eƒented
to be Baptiƒed, one after another.
Let vs p°aye.
Lnightie and immo°tall God, the ayde of all
that nede, the helper of all that flee to thee fo°
ƒuccour, the life of them that beleue, and the
reƒurreccion of the dead: we call vpon thee fo°
theƒe infantes, that they cummyng to thy holy Baptiƒme,
may receyue remi±ion of theyr ƒinnes, by ƒpirituall regeneracion.
Receyue them (o Lo°de) as thou ha¥e p°omyƒed by
thy welbeloued ƒonne, ƒaying: Aƒke, & you ƒhall haue: ƒeke,
and you ƒhall fynde: knocke, and it ƒhalbe opened vnto you. 
Publyke Baptiƒme.
So geue nowe vnto vs that aƒke: Lette vs that ƒeke, fynde:
open thy gate vnto vs that knocke: that theƒe infantes maye
enioy the euerla¥yng benediccion of thy heauenly waƒhing,
and may come to the eternall kyngdome whiche thou ha¥e
p°omyƒed, by Ch°i¥e our Lo°de. Amen.
Then let the p°ie¥ lokyng vpon the chyid°en, ƒaye.
Commaunde thee, vncleane ƒpirite, in the name of
the father, of the ƒonne, and of the holy gho¥, that
thou come out, and departe from theƒe infantes,
whom our Lo°d Jeƒus Ch°i¥e hath vouchƒaued, to call to his
holy Baptiƒme, to be made memb°es of his body, and of his
