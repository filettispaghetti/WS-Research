Fo° loe, there is not a woo°d in my toungue, but thou (o
lo°de) knowe¥e it altogether.
Thou ha¥ faƒhioned me, behinde and befo°e, and layed thine
hande vpon me.
Such knowelage is to woonderfull and excellente fo° me : I
cannot attaine vnto it.
Whither ƒhall I goe then from thy ƒpirite? o° whither ƒhal I
goe then from thy p°eƒence?
If I clime vp into heauen, thou art there : If I goe down to
hel, thou art there alƒo.
If I take the winges of the mo°ning, and remaine in the
vttermo¥e partes of the ƒea;
Euen there alƒo ƒhal thy hande leade me, and thy righte
hande ƒhall holde me.
If I ƒaye : paraduenture the darkene±e ƒhall couer me, then
ƒhall my night bee turned to daye.
Yea the darkene±e is no darkene±e with thee: but the night
is all clere as the daye, the darkene±e and lyghte to thee are
bothe alike.
Fo° my reynes are thine, thou ha¥ coured me in my mothers
wombe, I wyll geue thankes vnto thee : fo° I am
fearefully and woonderouƒly made: meruailous are thy
woo°kes, and that my ƒoule knoweth right well.
My bones are not hidde from thee, though I bee made
ƒecretely, and faƒhioned beneath in the yearth.
Thine eyes did ƒee my ƒub¥aunce, yet being vnperfecte : and
in thy booke were al my memb°es w°itten.
Whiche daye by daye were faƒhioned, when as yet there
was none of them.
Howe dere are thy councels vnto me, O God? O howe
greate is the ƒumme of them? 
At the Buriall.
If I tell them, they are moe in noumb°e then the ƒande when
I wake vp, I am p°eƒent with thee.
Wilt thou not ƒley the wicked, O God? departe from me,
ye bloude thri¥ie men.
Fo° they ƒpeake vnrighteouƒly again¥e thee : and thyne enemies
take thy name in vaine.
Dooe not I hate them, O Lo°d, that hate thee? and am not I
greued with thoƒe that ryƒe vp again¥ thee?
Yea I hate them righte ƒo°e, euen as thoughe they were
myne enemies.
Trye me, O God, and ƒeeke the grounde of myne harte :
p°oue me and examine my thoughtes.
Looke well if there be any way of wickednes in me, and
leade me in the waye euerla¥ing.
Glo°y to the father, &c.
As it was in the beginning, &c.
Then ƒhall folowe this le±on, taken out of the xv. Chapter to the
Co°inthians, the fir¥e Epi¥le.
