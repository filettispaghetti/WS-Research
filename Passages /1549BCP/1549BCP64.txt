the cha¥ement of the lo°de: Fo° whom the lo°de loueth he
cha¥iƒeth. Yea, (as ƒaincte Paul ƒayth,) he ƒcourgeth euery
ƒonne, which he receiueth: yf you indure cha¥iƒement, he
offereth himƒelfe vnto you as vnto his owne child°en. What
ƒonne is he that the father cha¥iƒeth not? Yf ye be not vnder
co°reccion (wherof all the true child°en are partakers), then
are ye ba¥ardes, and not child°en. Therfo°e ƒeyng that
whan our carnal fathers doe co°rect vs, we reuerently obey
them, ƒhall we not now much rather be obedient to our ƒpirituall
father, & ƒo liue? And they fo° a fewe daies doe cha¥iƒe
vs after they° owne pleaƒure: but he doeth cha¥iƒe vs fo° our
p°ofite, to thentente [the intent] he maye make vs partakers
of his holines. Theƒe wo°des, good b°other, are Gods
wo°des, and w°yten in holy ƒcripture fo° our coumfo°t and
in¥ruccion, that we ƒhould paciently and with thankes

by any maner of aduerƒitie it ƒhall pleaƒe his gracious goodne±e
to viƒite vs. And there ƒhould be no greater coumfo°t to
ch°i¥ian perƒons, then to be made lyke vnto Ch°i¥, by
ƒufferyng paciently aduerƒities, troubles, & ƒickene±es. Fo°
he himƒelfe wente not vp to ioy, but fir¥e he ƒuffered payne:
he entred not into his glo°y, befo°e he was crucified. So
truely our waye to eternall ioy is to ƒuffre here with
Ch°i¥e, and our doo°e to entre into eternal life: is gladly to
dye with Ch°i¥e, that we may ryƒe againe from death, and
dwell with him in euerla¥ing life. Now therfo°e taking
your ƒickene±e, which is thus p°ofitable fo° you, paciently:
I exho°te you in the name of God, to rememb°e the p°ofe±ion,
which you made vnto God in your Baptiƒme. And
fo°aƒmuch as after this lyfe, there is accompte to be geuen
vnto the ryghteous iudge, of whom all mu¥ be iudged
without reƒpecte of perƒons: I require you to examine your-

accuƒyng and condemnyng yourƒelfe fo° your owne faultes,
you may fynde mercy at our heauenly fathers hande, fo°
Ch°i¥es ƒake, and not be accuƒed and condemned in that
fearfull iudgement. Therfo°e I ƒhall ƒho°tely rehearƒe the
articles of our fayth, that ye maye knowe whether you doe
beleue as a ch°i¥ian manne ƒhould beleue, o° no.
Here the mini¥er ƒhall rehearƒe the articles of the fayth

Doest thou beleue in God the father almyghtie?
And ƒo fo°th as it is in Baptiƒme.
Then ƒhall the mini¥er examine whether he be in
