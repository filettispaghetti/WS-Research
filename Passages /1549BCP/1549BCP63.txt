Anƒwer.
And let my crye come vnto thee.
Mini¥er.
Let vs p°aye.
Lo°d looke downe from heauen, beholde, viƒite,
and releue this thy ƒeruaunte: Looke vpon hym
with the iyes of thy mercy, geue hym coumfo°te,
and ƒure confidence in thee: Defende him from the daunger
of the enemie, and kepe hym in perpetual peace, and ƒafetie:
th°ough Jeƒus Ch°i¥e our Lo°de. Amen.
Eare vs, almightie and mo¥e merciful God, and
Sauiour: Extende thy accu¥omed goodne±e to
this thy ƒeruaunt, which is greued with ƒickene±e: Viƒite
hym, o Lo°de, as thou didde¥ viƒite Peters wifes mother,
and the Capitaines ƒeruaunt. And as thou p°eƒerued¥ Thobie
and Sara by thy Aungel from daunger: So re¥o°e vnto
this ƒicke perƒon his fo°mer helth, (if it be thy will,) o° els
geue hym grace ƒo to take thy co°reccion, that after this
painfull lyfe ended, he maye dwell with thee in lyfe euerla¥yng.
Amen.
Then ƒhall the Mini¥er exho°te the ƒicke perƒon after this
fourme, o° other lyke.
Erely beloued, know this that almighty God is
the Lo°de ouer lyfe, and death, and ouer all
thynges to them perteyning, as yougth,
¥rength, helth, age, weakene±e, and ƒickene±e.
Wherfo°e, whatƒoeuer your ƒickenes is, knowe you certaynly
that it is Gods viƒitacion. And fo° what cauƒe ƒoeuer
this ƒickene±e is ƒent vnto you; whether it bee to trye your
pacience fo° the example of other, & that your fayth may be
founde, in the day of the Lo°de, laudable, glo°ious, and honourable,
to the encreaƒe of glo°y, and endele±e felicitie:
O°els it be ƒent vnto you to co°recte and amende in you,
whatƒoeuer doeth offende the iyes of our heauenly father:
knowe you certainly, that if you truely repent you of your
ƒynnes, & beare your ƒickenes paciently, tru¥ing in Gods
mercy, fo° his dere ƒonne Jeƒus Ch°i¥es ƒake, and rend°e 
The viƒitacion of the ƒicke.
If the perſon
viſited bee
very ſicke,
then the curate
may end
his exhortacion
at this
place. *
vnto him humble thankes fo° his fatherly viƒitacion, ƒubmytting
yourƒelfe wholy to his wil; it ƒhal turne to your
p°ofite, & helpe you fo°ewarde in the ryght waye that leadeth
vnto euerla¥yng lyfe.* Take therfo°e in good wo°the,
