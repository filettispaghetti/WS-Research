amendes to hys vttermo¥e power. And if he haue
not afo°e diƒpoƒed his goodes, let him then make his
will. (But men mu¥ be oft admoniƒhed that they ƒet
an o°d°e fo° their tempo°all goodees & landes whan
they be in helth.) And alƒo to declare his debtes,
what he oweth, & what is owing to him: fo°
diƒcharging of his conƒcience & quietne±e of his
executours. The mini¥er may not fo°get no° omitte
to moue the ƒicke perƒon (and that mo¥e earne¥ly)
to lyberalitie towarde the poo°e.
This may be done
befo°e the mini¥er
begyn his p°ayers, as
he ƒhal ƒee cauƒe.
¶ Here ƒhall the ƒicke perƒon make a ƒpeciall
confe±ion, yf he fele his conƒcience troubled with
any weightie matter. After which confe±ion, the
p°ie¥ ƒhall abƒolue hym after this fo°me: and the
ƒame fo°me of abƒolucion ƒhalbe vƒed its all p°yuate
confe±ions.
Ur Lo°d Jeƒus Ch°i¥, who hath lefte power to
his Churche to abƒolue all ƒinners, which truely
repent and beleue in hym: of his great mercy fo°-
geue thee thyne offences: and by his auto°itie committed to
me, I abƒolue thee from all thy ƒynnes, in the name of the
father, and of the ƒonne, and of the holy go¥. Amen.
And then the p°ie¥ ƒhall ƒaye the collette folowyng.
Let vs p°aye. 
The viƒitacion of the ƒicke.
O Mo¥ mercifull God, which acco°ding to the multitude
of thy mercies, doe¥ ƒo putte away the ƒynnes of thoƒe
which truely repent, that thou rememb°e¥ them nomo°e:
open thy iye of mercy vpon this thy ƒeruaunt, who mo¥e
earne¥ly deƒireth pardon and fo°geuene±e: Renue in hym,
mo¥e louyng father, whatƒoeuer hath been decayed by the
fraude and malice of the deuil, o° by his owne carnall, wyll
& frailne±e: p°eƒerue and continue this ƒicke memb°e in the
vnitie of thy Churche, conƒyder his contricion, accepte his
teares, aƒwage his payne, as ƒhalbe ƒeen to thee mo¥e expedient
fo° him. And fo°aƒmuch as he putteth his full tru¥
only in thy mercy: Impute not vnto him his fo°mer ƒinnes,
but take him vnto thy fauour: th°ough the merites of thy
mo¥e derely beloued ƒonne Jeƒus Ch°i¥e. Amen.
Then the mini¥er ƒhall ƒaye this pƒalme.
IN thee, O Lo°de haue I put my tru¥, let me neuer be
put to confuƒion, but ridde me, and deliuer me into thy
righteouƒnes: enclyne thyne eare vnto me, andƒaue me.
In te domine
ſperaui, pſal.
