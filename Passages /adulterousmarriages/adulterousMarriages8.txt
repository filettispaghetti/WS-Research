the bond remaineth in them both, wher by the woman is bowndē so long as her husband liueth, be he a continent liuer or an adulterour and that therfor the woman which is put away cōmitteth adulteri, if she marie, and that he is an adulte¦rour that mariethe a woman put away, whether her husbande that put her away be an adulterour or a continent liuer, because the wo∣mā is bowndē so long as her hus∣band liueth. But now we dispute of the cōplaintes of incontinent li∣uers. What is thought mor right wise thā the complaint of this wo∣man that saithe, I am put away, & haue not put away, and because to liue continently is giuen to few, I haue not liued continētly, but leste I shuld cōmitte fornication haue maried, & yet I am sayde to haue
Page  [unnumbered]
cōmitted adulteri because I haue maried? Shal we for this woman as it wer a iuste complaint, thinke the lawe of God is to be chāged yt we shuld not iudge this womā to be an adulteresse? god forbid. But ye wyll answere that the woman ought not to haue been put away, for that no cause of fornication was giuen before. You say truth. For ye lord expressed her husbādes syn, wher he sayd, he that putteth away his wife excepte the cause of fornication: maketh her to cōmit adultrie. But did not she therfore synne after in marieng, because he synned befor in putting her way? Therfor what dothe it profit him that the woman not liuinge conti∣nently complayneth of the lawe of Christe, excepte he for hys murmu¦ringe be punyshed?

Nowe let vs see those thynges that ye added in an other place,* & wold haue me to make answer to them. Where it moueth you, and you haue pitie of that man, that al¦though it be not for that he liueth not continētly, yet at leaste for the necessitie to beget children, is com¦pelled to lye with an adulteresse, if it be not lawful for hym so to put her away, that he may marie an o∣ther she being alyue: Wher vpon you shulde be iustely moued, yf it were not adulterye to marye an o∣ther, his adulterouse wyfe beynge aliue. But yf it be adulterie, (as the thinges before disputed haue taught) why is the cause of byget∣tynge chyldren pretended? We may not therfore permit and giue a licence, to heynowse crimes, and we may not so auoyd to dye with∣out
Page  [unnumbered]
yssue of chyldren, as we muste choose & laboure to lyue oure sel∣fes for euermore. And adulterers be not suffred to lyue euermore, who after ye firste death, muste ne∣des be condēned by ye eternitie of the secōd deathe. This excuse and allegation for the bygettinge of chyldrene, compellethe men to put away not onely adulterouse wo∣men but also moste chaste womē, yf perchaunce they be bareyn, and to mary other, which thing I sup∣pose pleasethe not you. Wherfore yf adulteries be not to be excused for ye cause of not liuing cōtinent∣ly, how moche lesse are they excu∣sable, for the cause of bygettinge of children.

*This infirmitie of incōtinent li∣uinge, ye Apostel wold haue relea∣ued by ye honestie of mariage, for he saithe not, yf she haue no chyl∣dren
Page  [unnumbered]
let her marye, but, yf she lyue not cōtinently, let her marye. The generation of children is a recom¦pence, for that she giuethe place to incontinēt life by marienge. For incōtinency is a vice, but mariage is no vice, & therfore by this good the other is made veniall euell. Seing therfore mariage is insti∣tute for generation, for that cause oure fathers wer maried, yt onely for generation & not vnlawfully dyd company wyth women. For than ther was a certaine necessi∣tie of procreation, whiche is not nowe, because ther is a tyme of embracing (as it is written) which truely was than,* and ther is a time of absteininge from embracinge, which is now. Of the which tyme the Apostell speakynge, saithe: frō hence forthe, brethren, the tyme is
Page  [unnumbered]
shorte, it folowethe that they that haue wyues, be as not hauynge wiues. Wherupon at this time it is very wel and aptly said, he that can take, let him take, and she that liuethe not continently, let her ma∣rye. Continencye than descended to the offyce of matrimonie for the generation of chyldren: but nowe the bonde of mariage, releauethe the vyce of incontinencye, that of them that lyue not continentlye shulde come the generation of chil¦dren, not by the dishonestie of for∣nications, but by the honestye of mariages. Why than saythe not the Apostell, yf she haue no chyl∣drē, let her marye? because at this tyme of absteynyng from embra∣cīg, it is not necessarily to bygette children. And why saithe he, if she liue not continently let her marye?
Page  [unnumbered]
Truely therfore, leste by her incō∣tinencie she be compelled to cōmit fornication. Yf therfore she liue cō¦tinently, let her neyther marye nor bring forthe childrē, but if she liue not cōtinētly, let her marie lawful∣ly leste she bring forthe chyldrē vn¦lawfully, or els leste she vsing car¦nall copulation more vnlawfully bring forthe no children at al. Al∣thoughe thys that I sayde laste, some men doo it, that be also ma∣ryed lawfulli. For a mā lieth with his lawful wife vnlawfully, & dis∣honesteli, wher the cōceiuyng of a child is auoided. Whiche thynge Onan ye sonne of Iudas dyd, & for ye god killed him.* Therfore ye ge∣neratiō of childrē is the first & na∣tural cause of maryage, & for that cause they yt be maried by reason of incontinencie, oughte not so to
Page  [unnumbered]
temper & moderate their euel, that they bānyshe the goodnes of ma∣riage, that is to say, the fruite of childrē. For the Apostell spake of incontinent liuers whē he said.* I wil that the yonger vydowes doo marie, & bring forthe chyldrē, & be huswifes, & to gyue no occasiō to the aduersarie of euel speakinge. For now certayn be, turned backe after Sathā. When he said: I wil ye yōger to mary, he counseyled yt. to stay the fal of incontinencie, but leste peraduenture they shulde thynke onely of the infirmitie of carnall concupiscēce, whiche onely muste be serued & releaued in the worke of mariage, and leste the goodnes of mariage be eyther cō∣temned or neglected: he sayde by & by after: and to bryng forthe chyl∣dren, and to be huswyfes. They yt choose to lyue continently, choose truely a better thynge, than is the
Page  [unnumbered]
goodnes of mariage, yt is to saye, than the generation of chyldren. Yf continencie be chosen, for thys intent, to take vpon them a better thing than ye goodnes of mariage howe moche more ought it to be kepte to auoid adulterye. For whē the Apostell had saide, yf she lyue not continently, let her marye: for it is better, saide he, to be maried than burn, he sayd not, it is better to commytt adulterie than burn.*

Ther is nothinge wherunto we may exhorte these that feare to be recōciled to their adulterous wifes or husbādes, being purged & hea∣led by penaūce, but to kepe conti∣nencie. For a woman is boundē so longe as her adulterouse or chast husbād liueth, & cōmitteth adulte∣ry, yf she marye an other: and a man is bounden so longe as hys adulterouse or chaste wyfe liue∣the and committethe adultery yf he marye an other. Thys bonde
Page  [unnumbered]
truely is not dissolued, althoughe the wife beyng chaste of her body be separate by dyuorse, moch lesse it is dissolued, yf she be not sepa∣rate and commyt adulterye. And therfore nothynge dissolueth this bond, but the deathe of the man or the wyfe, not fallyng into adulte∣rye, but departing owt of the bodi Wherfore yf a wyfe go frō her a∣dulterouse husband and wyll not be reconcyled to hym agayne, let her remayn vnmaryed: and yf a man put awaye hys adulterouse wyfe, and wyll not receyue her a∣gayn, no not after her penance, let hym kepe continencye: although not of wil to chose the better good, yet at leste of necessitie to auoyde the perniciouse euyll. To this also I wolde exhorte, yf the wyfe wer holden with a long and incurable
Page  [unnumbered]
sickenes, or els yf she were corpo∣rally separate and kepte in some place, whyther her husband could not haue accesse. Laste of all to thys also I wolde exhorte, yf the woman disposed and wyllynge to lyue continently, wolde, beynge chaste her selfe, put away her chaste husbande, althoughe it is agaynste the discipline, because it is not by mutuall consent. For I thinke no Chrystē man withstan∣dethe hym to be an adulteroure, that hys wyfe eyther beynge long sycke, or lōge absent, or desyrouse to lyue continently, kepeth carnall companie with an other woman. euen so in lyke maner a man put∣ting awaye his adulterouse wyfe, lyuethe beyng an adulteroure, wt an adultresse because, not he or he but euery man that putteth away
Page  [unnumbered]
hys wyfe and mariethe an other, committethe adulterie. Wherfore yf the lyfe of holy men whiche is free from the bond of mariage is not desired: let the punishment of adulterers be feared. And at leste let concupiscence be brydelyd with feare, yf continencie be not chosen by loue. Yf wher feare is, their la∣boure workethe also: truely where labour was, ther shall loue be. We may not truste of oure own strength, but prayer muste be ioy∣ned to oure labours & indeuours, that he myght kyll vs with good, that fearethe vs from euell.

Let vs answer also to that, yt you thynke,* men are compelled to pu∣nishe their adulterous wifes with out any mercy, when they wolde haue them deade, if it be not law∣full for them to marye other du∣ringe their wifes lifes. And going
Page  [unnumbered]
about to amplyfie thys crueltie, you said, thys semethe not to me, moste louing father, to be a godly sense, wher gentilnes and pitie be excluded. These wordes you speake, as thoughe men oughte therfore to fauor & spare their adul¦terous wifes, because they may mary other, or yf they may not, yt than they shuld not spare thē, for thys intent that they might marye other. But rather they oughte to shewe mercy to their sinful wifes that they thē selfes myghte obteyn mercy for ther sinnes. And moche more thys oughte to be doon of thē yt puttinge away their adulte∣rous wifes, desire to liue continēt∣ly: for they oughte so moche to be more merciful, as they laboure to be more holy, yt they may be holpē of god to preserue chastytie in thē selfes, whiles that they reuēge not
Page  [unnumbered]
the violation and breache of cha∣stitie in their wiues, and specially that word of the lord is to be cal∣led to memorie, he that is wtout sinne let him firste cast a stone a∣gainst her: not he yt is without that sinne, as we speake of chaste men, but he yt is without sinne, whyche thinge yf they say they be, they de∣ceue them selues and truthe is not in thē. But yf they doo not seduce them selues, & yf truthe be in them there shall not be in thē any cruell & bluddy seueritie. For knowinge thē selues not to be without sinne, they forgyue that they myghe be forgyuen, and mercy and pitie are not excluded from them. But ra∣ther they be excluded, yf licētiouse pleasure and not carefull pitie, dyd obteyne of them pardon for there wiues synne, that is to saye
Page  [unnumbered]
that thēy shulde therfore fauoure and spare them, because, they may marie other: and not ra∣ther therfore, because they would god shulde fauour and spare thē. Therfore how moch better, hone∣ster and worthier is it a Christen mans professiō, to spare the bloud of adulterouse wiues because it is writtē,* forgiue thy neyghbors vn∣ryghtuosnes, & then at thy praier thy sinnes shall be loused. A man reserueth hys angre to a man and askethe a medecine of the lorde, he hathe no mercy vpon a man lyke hym selfe, and for his own sinnes he askethe mercy. Seing he being fleshe reseruethe angre, who shall haue mercy vpon his sinnes? And in the gospel.* Forgyue and it shal be forgyuen to you, that we may say forgyue vs our debtes as we
Page  [unnumbered]
forgiue thē that be debters to vs. And in the Apostell,* rendrynge to no man euel for euel, & suche lyke saynges yf ther be any holy scrip∣ture, wherby when a mans mynde is prouoked to vengeaunce, be∣cause he is a Chrysten man, he is mitigated.

*How moche better is it to speake after thys sorte as I haue tolde, thā to saie thus, forgiue ōely your adulterouse wifes, & seke not their bloud, all the sorow you tooke for their noughty liuing, the comfor∣te of your newe wifes whiche you shal marie, wyll take it away, for you myghte righte well desire to take thē oute of their lifes yf their lyfe were a stoppe to you for ma∣rieng of other, but nowe whē they beynge aliue, it is lawfull to pro∣uide for your selfes other wyfes, why shuld you desyre so moche to
Page  [unnumbered]
kyll thē? Yf we say thus, doo you not marke howe moche thys per∣suasion is agaynste ye foorme of a Christē mans life, because bothe it is false yt they may doo which they may not, yt is to saye, their adulte∣rouse wifes being aliue, to be cou¦pled wt other: & also yf they ther∣fore fauoure & spare thē, they shal not spare thē for pitie & godlines, but for yt they haue fre libertie to marie again. Laste of al, I aske of you, whether it be lawfull for a Chrysten husbād, eyther by ye olde law of god, or by ye romains law, to caste away or kyl his wife? If it be lawful it is better, to refreyn him selfe from both, that is to say, bothe from lawfull punyshment, yf she doo synne, and also frō vn∣lawful mariage, yf she be alyue. And yf he continue erneste to choose ye one, it is better for him to
Page  [unnumbered]
doo that is lawfull, that the adul∣tresse be punished, then to doo that is vnlawfull, that she beyng alyue, he commyt adultery. But yf that be saide that is more true, that it is not laufull for a Chry∣sten man to kyll hys adulterouse wyfe, but onely to put her away: who is so madde as to say vnto hym, doo that is vnlaufull, that it may be laufull for you to doo yt is vnlauful. For when by Chry∣stes law, both is vnlawful, eyther to kyll the adultresse, or to mary an other she beynge alyue: men must absteyn from bothe, and not doo one vnlawfull thynge for an other. But yf he wyll nedes doo that is vnlawful, let him than cō∣mit adultery, and not murdre, and rather to marye an other, hys wife beinge aliue, than to shedde mans bloud.
Page  [unnumbered]
and yf bothe be cruell wykednes, he ought not to doo the one for the other, but to auoyd bothe.

Here I see what may be saide of those yt lyue not cōtinently,* that he that puttethe away hys adulte∣rouse wyfe, & suffrethe her to lyue, yf he marie an other, so longe as his firste wyfe liuethe, he is a per∣petuall adulteroure, and dothe no fruitfull penaūce in yt he leauethe not hys wicked lyfe, & yf he be vn∣chrystened & a learner of the ca∣techisme, he is not admitted to ba∣ptisme, because he is not chaūged from that, yt letthethe hym, nor can not be recōciled by any means, cō∣tinuinge in the same wickednes. But yf he accusynge hys adulte∣rouse wyfe doo kyll her, thys synn because he is paste it, & remaineth not in it, if it be cōmitted of a lear∣ner
Page  [unnumbered]
of oure faith, it is washed and purged by baptisme, and yfit be doon of hym that is Chrystened it is made hole by penaūce and re∣conciliation. But shal we therfore say adultery is no adultery, which without doubt is cōmitted, if an∣other wyfe be maried, ye first adul∣terous wyfe beyng aliue? But ex∣ceptyng this kynde of adultery, you put no doubtes but that it is adultery, if any man marry ye wife of him that liueth, whiche is put a way from her husband by a lybell of diuorse without any fornicatiō of the woman. What say we than, when he shal see himselfe not to be admitted to Baptisme, if he bee a learner, nor to do penāce fruitful∣ly, if he did this fault beyng chri∣stened, in that he correcteth not and forsaketh not his offēce: if he wold
