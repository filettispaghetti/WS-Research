Apostle counsaileth, the lord for∣byddeth, nor that the Apostle for¦byddeth, the Lord cōmaundeth. Whiche thyng if it were not so, neither the Apostle would coun∣sail any thyng against the lordes prohibition, nor would forbyd a∣ny thyng against the Lordes cō∣maunded. Wherfore in these two causes, the one concernyng mari∣yng and not mariyng, the other concernyng puttyng away or not putting away the infidele partie: In the Apostles wordes there is some thyng like▪ some thyng vn∣like. The lyke thyng is that both there he sayth, I haue no com∣maundement of the Lord, but do geue counsail, and here he sayth: I say, not the Lorde. For this saiyng, I haue no cōmaundemēt of the Lord, is like to this, The
Page  [unnumbered]
Lord sayth not. and this saiyng, I counsail, is lyke to this, I say. But this is vnlyke that concer∣nyng mariyng and not mariyng, it may be sayd, this is well done, that is better, because both be ex∣pediēt; the one lesse, ye other more But concernyng the puttyng a∣way or not puttyng away of the infidele partie, it may not be sayd he that putteth away doth well, & he that putteth not away dothe better, but it must be said, let him not put away, for althoughe it be laweful, yet it is not expediente. Thus we may saye, it is better not to put away the infydle wife or husbande, although it be law∣ful to put hym or her away euen as we say well, it is better, that is lawful and expedyēt, then that is lawful and not expediente.

For these causes,* when I ex∣poundyng the Lordes longe ser∣mon whiche he made vppon the Mountaine, came to that questy∣on concernynge the puttynge a∣way of wyues or not puttynge away, ioynyng also therunto the testimonies of the Apostle: I said it was the Apostles councel, and not the Lordes commaundement where he sayd. To other I saye,* not the Lorde, counsellyng those that had infidel wyfes not to put them away, if they consented to dwel with them. Whiche thynge truely was to be counselled and not to be cōmaunded, for mē may not be forbidden with such great weight and charge to do thinges lawful althoughe not expedyent, as thei be forbiddē to do thyngs vnlawfull. And yf at any tyme
Page  [unnumbered]
the Apostle did vouchfafe to coū∣sel those thynges that were also to be commaunded: that did he to fauoure mens infirmytie, not to do any preiudice to Goddes com∣maundement. For whiche cause he sayde, I wryte these thynges not to cōfound you, but I admo∣nishe you as most derely beloued children. What questiō is in this that he saith, I say, not the lord? lykewyse where he saith. Behold I Paul say vnto you, that yf ye be cicumcised,* Chryst wyll pro∣fyte you nothing: dyd he not also in this place saye, I say, not the Lord? But these be not lyke, be∣cause it is not vnsemely nor con∣trary, if the Apostle councel these thinges that the lorde also com∣maundeth. For we counsell and admonishe them whom we loue,
Page  [unnumbered]
to do the preceptes or cōmaunde∣mētes of the Lord. But when he sayth, I say, not the lord, he she∣weth sufficiētly that the lord for¦biddeth not that he forbad. And ye Lord would haue forbydden it, if it had been vnlauful. Therfore accordyng to those thynges that we haue before long and muche disputed: it was lawfull by righ∣teousnes, & yet beyng lawfull it was not to be done for good wil and free beneuolence.

But you, whose opiniō is, that it is aswell vnlawful that ye lord forbiddeth not, but ye Apostle,* as it is vnlauful that the Lord for∣byddeth. When ye would haue ex¦pounded what ment this saiyng of the Apostle, I say, not the lord, whereas the Apostle spake vnto christians that wer maried with infideles, you sayd that the Lord
Page  [unnumbered]
cōmaunded there shuld be no ma∣riages made with theim that be of a diuers religion, & ye brought in the testimony of the Lord, sai∣yng: Thou shalt not take a wyfe to thy sonne of the doughters of straungers borne,* least she leade him after her gods, and his soule perishe. You did also adde ye wor∣des of the Apostle wher he sayth: A woman is bounden so long as her husbād liueth. But if her hus∣band be dead, she is free to marry whom she wyll, onely in the lord. Which you expoūded so, that you added, that is to say, to a christiā. Thā you added further. This is therfore the cōmaundemēt of the Lord aswell in the old testament as in the newe, that no parties should remaine beyng coupled in mariage except they be of one re∣ligion & faith. Than if this be the
Page  [unnumbered]
Lordes cōmaundement bothe in the olde testament and the newe, and if the Lord cōmaunde it and the Apostle teache it, that no ma∣riage remaine coupled but of one religion and fayth: Why than a∣gainst the lordes cōmaundemēt, against his own doctrin, against the precept of the olde testament and the newe, dothe the Apo∣stle cōmaund, not only coūsaileth but also cōmaundeth, that if the husband or wyfe receiue ye fayth, the one should not put away the other beyng an infidele if the in∣fidele consent to dwel with him? By these your wordes you shew euidently inough that this is one thyng and that another. For that (as you say) the Lord byddeth, ye Apostle teacheth, both the testa∣mentes cōmaunde. But this is a∣nother matter, who can denye?
Page  [unnumbered]
where it is intreated, not of those that are to be maried, but of those that be already maried. For thei wer both of one infidelitie when they were maryed, but when the gospel came, the mā without the wife, or the wife without the mā receyued the fayth. Than if this be a diuers thyng, as it appereth without any scruple or doubte: why doth not the Lord cōmaund as the Apostle doth, that the chri∣stian should remaine in mariage with the infidele, except peraduē∣ture that lacketh in this place, that he himselfe sayd so boldly in another place. Wyll ye receiue an experiment of Christe that spea∣keth in me?* And truely Chryst is the lord: vnderstād you not what I say? or shall I tary in this and declare it a litel better? mark whe¦ther I do not in a playner speche
Page  [unnumbered]
laye the matter as it were before your eies to be cōsidered. Behold ther be two maried persons, both infidels when they were maried: in these two there is no question that can perteine to the lordes cō¦mandement, and the Apostles do∣ctrine, and the precept of the olde and newe testament, whereby a ← Christian → is forbiddē to ioyne in mariage with an infidel, for now they be man and wife and as yet bothe be infidels, as yet they be such as thei were before they ma¦ried, and as they were maried. the precher of the gospel cōmeth, one of them he or she receyueth the faith, but so that the other infidel cōsenteth to dwel with the Chri∣stian, whether doth the Lord cō∣maunde the Chrystyan to put a∣way the infidel, or not cōmaund? yf you say he commaundeth: the
Page  [unnumbered]
Apostle gain saith, I saye, not the Lorde. If you say he commaun∣deth not, I aske the cause why. You wyl not aunswere the cause which you put in your letters, yt the Lord forbiddeth Christians to be maried to infidels: for that is no cause in this matter where we speke of persōs maried, not of persons to be maried. If therfore you haue found no cause why the Lorde shulde not forbid that the Apostle forbiddeth, (for you see nowe as I suppose, that it is no cause which you thought before was one) then consyder whether this be ye cause which I thought was it, and was then to be spokē and now to be defended, that the Lorde sayth that thinge, whiche rightwisnes before him permyt∣teth, which may not be trāsgres∣sed by any meanes, that is to say,
Page  [unnumbered]
whiche the Lord so cōmaundeth or forbiddeth yt it is not lawfull at all to do otherwyse. For what thyng he permitteth to the liber∣tie of mans free wyl, either to do or not to doo lawfully: therin he semeth to geue place to the coun∣sail of his seruauntes, that they shuld rather coūsel that they shal see expediēt. Let this rule be first and specially kept, that no vnlaw¦ful thynges be done. And where any thyng is lawefull after that sorte, that to do otherwyse is not altogether vnlawful: Than let it be done that is expedient, or that is more expedient. For that the Lord sayth as the Lord, that is to say, not by the aduice of a coū∣sailor, but by the cōmaundement of a ruler, it is not lawfull to do those thynges, & therfore not ex∣pedient. The lord comaundeth a
Page  [unnumbered]
woman not to go away from her husbād, but if she go away, (that is to say, for that cause for whi∣che it is lauful so to do) to remain vnmaried or els to be reconciled to her husbād. For a maryed wo∣man, her husband beyng aliue, is bounden to the lawe, and duryng his life she shalbe called an adul∣teresse, if she be wt another hus∣band, because the woman is boū∣den so long as her husbād liueth. Wherfore if a wife put away her husbād & marierh another, she cō∣mitteth adultery, and he that ma∣ryeth her that is put fro her hus∣bād, is an adulteror. And so by ye same cōmaundement of the lord, let a man not put away his wife, for he yt putteth away his wyfe without cause of fornication, ma¦keth her to cōmitte adultery, but if he put her away for that cause, yet let him remain so.

Page  [unnumbered]
For euery man that putteth a∣way his wyfe & marieth another is an adulteror.* These constitu∣cions of ye Lord must be obserued without any breach or retractiō. For righteousnes before God wylleth these thynges, whether men allowe them or disalow thē. And therfore it may not be sayd, that they ought not to bee kepte, lest men be offēded, or lest men be stopped frō that saluacion which is in Christ. For what ← christian → man dare say, lest I offend men, or to wynne men to Christ, I wyll cause my wife to cōmit adultery, or I be my self an adulteror? For it may come to passe that a chri∣sten mā when he hath put away his wife for adultry, may be thus tempted, that a certaine woman whiche hath not yet receiued the faith, desiryng to be maried to hī,
Page  [unnumbered]
do promise that she wyll become a ← christian → not deceitfully, but in very deede, if he wyll marry her. And when the man refuseth this mariage, the tempter may make this suggestion, the Lord sayth, whosoeuer putteth away his wif without the cause of fornication, and marieth another is an adulte∣ror. But if thou that hast put a∣way thy wyfe for fornication, do marry another: thou shalt not cō∣mit adultery. To this suggestion let him wisely answer, that he cō¦mitteth more greuous adultery yt puttyng away his wyfe without the cause of fornication, maryeth another: but yet he that after his wyfe putte away for fornication hath maried another, is not ther∣fore no adulteror because he hath put away an adulteresse, as he is an adulteror that maryeth her yt
Page  [unnumbered]
is put away without cause of for¦nication, nor yet therfore he is no adulteror that maried her whō he found put away for the cause of fornication. And for that cause, yt which in S. Mathew is put very darkely, wher the whole is signi∣fied by ye part: is set furth plainly in other that haue expressed the hole generally, as it is red in S. Marke: whosoeuer putteth away his wife & marieth another cōmit¦teth adultery. And in S. Luke, Euery mā that putteth away his wife and marieth another cōmit∣teth adultery. They say not, some do cōmyt adultery, and not other some that put away their wyues and marry other: but whosoeuer putteth away, euery mā, say thei, without exception that putteth away his wife and marieth ano∣ther cōmitteth adultery.

Page  [unnumbered]
*But if the christiā answer thus to the tempter, vnderstāding that it is lawfull for him to put away his wife for fornication, but not lawful to marry another: What if that tempter say, cōmit this sinne for this intent, to wynne the wo∣mans soule to Christ, that is dead by infidelitie, who is ready to be made a ← christian → , if she be maried to thee: what can the ← Christian → answere els or say, but that if he do it, he can not escape cōdemna∣cion, which ye Apostle made men∣ciō of,* saiyng: And as some report vs to say, let vs do euil, that good may come, whose iudgement is iust? Howe can she be a true chri∣stian womā, that shal liue in adul∣tery with him that maried her?

Adultery is not only not to be committed,* which not certain mē commit, but euery man that put∣teth
Page  [unnumbered]
away his wife and marryeth an other, althoughe he marry her for this intēt to make her a chry∣stian: But also whosoeuer beinge not bounden to a wyfe, hath vo∣wed to God to liue contynentlye, ought by no menes to sin by this pretence and recompence, that he shulde beleue therefore he myght marry her to his wife, bicause she that desyreth his maryage hath promised to becom a Chrystyan. For that thyng that is laufull to any man before he hath vowed, is not lauful whē he hath vowed he wil neuer do it, if he vow that thynge that he may vowe, as for example, perpetuall virginitie, or els, continent life after the experi∣ence of matrimony when the par∣ties be losed from the bond of ma∣riage, or by the mutual cōsent of the parties liuing, and relesynge
Page  [unnumbered]
carnal debte one to an other, both the parties beyng faythfull and chast, whiche thing is not lauful for the man to vowe without the wyfe, nor the wyfe withoute the man. These thinges and suche o∣ther as may be vowed very well, after that men haue vowed them may be broken by no condicyon which were vowed without any cōdicion. For we must vnderstād that ye Lord cōmaunded so wher it is red,* vowe & performe your vowes to your lord God. Wher∣vpon the Apostle cōcernyng cer∣tain women that vowed continē∣cie, and afterward would marry, whiche before they had vowed was lawfull for thē to do, sayth: Hauyng damnation because thei haue made voyde their first fayth and promise.* Therfore nothyng is expedient that is vnlawfull, &
Page  [unnumbered]
nothyng is lawfull that the lord forbiddeth.

As for those thynges that be restrayned by no cōmaundement of the Lord,* but be left in the po∣wer & libertie of mā: Let vs heare and obey the Apostle monishyng and counsellyng in the holy gost, either to take thinges that be bet∣ter, or to beware of thinges that be not expedient. On the one side let the Apostle be heard▪ saiyng: I haue no precept of the Lord, but geue counsel. And I say, not the Lord. On ye other side where the hearer chooseth the better, let him be heard, saiyng:* He that is loosed frō a wyfe let him not seke a wyfe, and if he take a wyfe he sinneth not. And also let a virgyn not marry, for he yt doth not geue her to mariage, dothe better, and he that doth geue her to mariage
Page  [unnumbered]
doth well. And also, the woman shalbe more happy if she remaine so, whiche when her husband is dead hath in her libertie to marry whom she wyll, only in the Lord which may be taken two wayes, either remainyng a ← christian → , or mariyng a ← christian → . For in the tyme of the reuelyng of the newe testament, I do not remēbre that it is without al ambiguities and doubtes declared in the gospel, or in the Apostles writynges, whe∣ther the Lord did forbyd ye chri∣stians to bee maried to infideles or no? Although the most blessed man Cyprian doubteth not of it, and doth not put it among small & light crymes, to ioyne mariage with infideles, & sayth, that that is to prostitute and to ioyne the mēbres of Christ with infideles and Gentiles. But because it is
