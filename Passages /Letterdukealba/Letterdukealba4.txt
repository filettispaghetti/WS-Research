Furthermore, if we consider in what e∣stimation we are with them, we shal soone perceiue whereof this hatred and malice is further sprong. It is manifest, that (by rea∣son of the neighbourhed which we haue wt the Germanes and other nations addicted to the Gospell) they haue alwayes estéemed vs for Lutherians and heretikes. I meane not onely of those that haue cast off the Popes religion, but in generall the whole Nation, perceyuing our people of nature not to be giuen to many ceremonies, and little estéeming the Apish toyes and trom∣peries which they haue learned of the Sar∣rasins, Moores, and other Heathen people. We sée what an Apes play they vse in the time of Lent, in scourging of them selues, with other mockeries, which they vse at our Lordes sepulchre (as they call it.) This they extéeme for ye greatest holynesse which may be. Nowe, they perceyuing that our countrie men, yea they that are most bent to the Roomish religion, do ieste and mocke at these their dooings, estéeming them as childrens toyes and méere hipocrisie. This also doth kindle in their harts an vnquench able hatred and enuie against vs, that they
Page  [unnumbered]
which account themselues so wise and fine witted, should of our Children, Wyues and simple people be estéemed as Hipocrites & superstitious fooles. And so by reason ther∣of, they do estéeme vs all in generall (fewe or none excepted) as Heretikes and Lu∣therians.

It is also manifest, that thei do hate∣and persecute the Lutherians more then the Iewes, Turkes or any other transgres∣sors that liue in this worlde: for with the Iewes, Turkes, Moores and Sarasins thei vse great familiaritie (for that ye most parte of them are spronge out of that race) but suche as they estéeme as Lutherians, they thinke them not worthie to enioye eyther Eyre, Water, Sunne, Moone, nor yit any other Element: yea thei doo persecute them by all the meanes they can deuise.

And to looke for any grace or pardon at their handes for respect of our owne per∣sons, (séeing they hate vs aboue all other creatures in the world) it were meere mad∣nesse: yea they think they do God good ser∣uice when soeuer they may cruelly mur∣ther any of vs. Besides this, they accompt this whole Countrie as rebellious, saying
Page  [unnumbered]
playnely, that in all the lowe Countries, there is not one Towne but hath forfeyted to the King their liberties, yea lyfe and goods, and haue purchased vnto them the displeasure and wrath of his Maiestie. The one for denying to receyue the Spanish garrisons: The other for neglecting the ex∣ecution of the Mandamentes & Placcards, in matters of Religion, and not punishing the Heretikes and offenders sufficiently. The third, for that they haue not sufficient∣ly ayded and assisted the Bishops, Inquisi∣tours and Spaniards. Others, for not graunting to the demaund of the x. pennie and other vnreasonable requestes: Some other because thei would not abyde the vn∣supportable violence of the Souldiours. In fine, there is not one Towne nor Uil∣lage in all the lowe Countries, which is not to be charged with losse of lyfe & goods: as is to be perceyued out of their owne al∣legations propound in the name of ye Duke of Alba, touching the x. pennie, saying, that such was demaunded to the intent that the Landes and countries which were fallen into the displeasure of the King, might thereby be reduced to his fauour. There∣fore
Page  [unnumbered]
we néede not to looke for any grace or fauour at their handes, and all that which they do alledge and say is to bee extéemed for none other then subtile practises, to bring the simple and vnwyse vnder their yoke, and after being Maisters ouer them to vse them at their pleasures, where∣in they will haue no such precise regarde to those that haue offended, as to those which hereafter might offēd, or with whose goods and possessions they might bée made rich for euer. So that there is none, being of any power, authoritie, or coūtenance, or hauing any goods, that shall escape frée, for he that will stryke a dogge, may soone find a staffe. And vndoutedly, this is ye true na∣ture & cōmon vse of all Tyrants that haue subdued any Townes, specially being be∣fore reuolted from them, that they neuer thinke their rule nor lyfe to be in suertye, vntill such time as they haue made away such as they doe suspecte, might, or would withstande their power.

Therfore all they which by seruitude (hel∣ping the Spaniards against their owne al∣lies, contrary to the dutie which they owe to their naturall countrie,) do in any wise
Page  [unnumbered]
hope therby to get their grace and fauour, surely shalbe the first that shall find them∣selues disceyued: for it will not be so pre∣cisely asked what they haue offended, as wherin hereafter thei might or could offēd. Much lesse maye they loke for any grace or fauour which before haue reuolted and withstoode their tiranny, and nowe vppon hope of pardon shall turne and become eni∣mies to their natiue countrie, for such they wil estéeme as double Traytours, of whose trueth they neuer can be assured, thincking always, that spying their commoditie they will reuolt againe. And what soeuer elles they here proponed touching their grace & fauour, is nothing elles but meere deceipt and subtiltie: so that none (hauing his vn∣derstanding and right senses) will beleue these promises, but rather with life and goodes, and by all possible meanes, helpe to defende his Countrie and the liberties therof.

And bycause it shall not be thought that this warning doth procede of affection ra∣ther then of a trueth, let vs first marke what kind of pardon they do propone, and then what assurance and certaintie they do
Page  [unnumbered]
offer first they say. That vnto those which returne againe to their obeisance shalbe gi∣uen perpetuall grace and fauour as is gi∣uen to those which alreadie are turned vnto them, being left in their former state, vsing and enioying their goodes and other things as they did before their reuolte. Hereby they giue to vnderstand, that at this pre∣sent their goodes are deteined as forfet, and that the Duke of Alba and the Spaniards do esteeme themselues as Lordes and pro∣prietaries of the liues and goods of the in∣dwellers of the same townes, like as be∣fore the reuolting of the townes, they haue diuers times made their vaunt, yet wyll they now of a special grace & fauour graunt them so much, as that for a while they shal enioy the vse of their goods, vntil such time as they find better oportunity to put in ex∣ecution that which long hath lyen in their mindes: for by the wordes before recited, is not expressed the reseruation which they kéepe to themselues: Namely, that the Re∣belles and heritickes and other whome it shall please them, should be punished accor∣ding to the nature and disposition of their offences. Besides this, no mention is made
Page  [unnumbered]
of the nobles & the whole cuntrie. So as all those that haue any goods, houses or lands, lying without the townes, can by no mea∣nes by the content of this letter be assured, only the inhabitants of the townes shoulde by this meanes be vsed as executors and accusers of the nobles and countrie. Then I pray you marke what kynd of assurance here is giuen. VVhich we in the name and behalfe of the kyng do certainely promise and assure you by these presents, & thought good hereof to aduertise you, to the intent you giue the same further to vnderstād. &c. Assuredly this is a proper assurance, vppon which one marchaunt wil scarce lend ano∣ther two pence: much lesse whole townes and countries aduenture their liues ther∣by, for what haue they not promised vs in the name and behalfe of the kings maiesty, and haue afterwards broken and infringed the same? as if they might make a iesting stake of the kynges maiestie at their plea∣sure, which vndoubtedly they doe. Howe often haue they promised these Countries, that they shold not be burthened with gar∣risons of Souldiours? That the Inquisitiō should not be brought into the coūtry? yea
Page  [unnumbered]
how solemply, & with what a countenance, did they promise & vowe to the nobles & country ye agrement made in August & confirmed by the Duches of Parma. And in these last warres, when haue they at any time kept promise? nay rather whē haue they not opēly & wtout any re∣spect broken & violated ye same? They had faith∣fully promised ye towne of Rotterdam, thei wold but passe through ye same without hurting any of the Citizins, & as sone as they were within, they began to murther execrably, as if they had bene a sort of rauening Wolues and murthe∣rers. They had promised the towne of Mounts in Henault that they would not harme any one Burges, vpon which condition they entred the towne, where they apprehended a great nūber & hong them vp. But I pray you how haue thei delt with the Counties of Egmont & of Horne? what faire promises had they made vnto them, yea confirmed with the kinges letters & seale, making them beleue al things were forgotten & forgiuen, that the king did fauour & was boū∣tifull to them, & that nothing should be cōcluded in the counsel without their aduise, with many other like wordes, wherwith they persuaded these good noble men that all things were wel, & so got them into their hands, to the intent to dispatch them away moste miserably, setting
Page  [unnumbered]
their heads vpon poles, as if they had bene mur¦therers or traytours? What faith or troth was kept with the Lords of Barow & Montigny, who were by the Duches of Parma & all the Lords & nobles of the country (for pacifying the state therof) so solēply sent in Ambassade to ye kings Maiestie? The Turkes and faithlesse heathens which know no God, do estéeme it an abhomi∣nable déed to endammage Emassadours or Cō∣missaries, being by all naturall reasons to bée estéemed as holy: Notwithstanding they kept those Lords as prisoners a great while, & in the end pitifully murthered them without law or Iustice. After this, what faith haue they kept with their owne souldiours, being vnder the re¦giment of the Countie Lodron, who serued him so long at Valencien? Did not the Duke of Alba promise & sweare to them, that the offences passed (to wit because they had demaunded to haue their payment) should be forgotten, and therupon gaue them his letters & seale, causing them to be written vp a new, & to take an oth to the king. And that which is more, caused thē to come from Valencien to Antwerpe vnder con∣duct there to receyue money, wheras he with his Spanish souldiours enuironed them, and in great nombers caused them to be hanged one after another: the rest which escaped hanging,
Page  [unnumbered]
he caused to be chased and driuen away without payment? Who then would séeme to be so mad or bewitched, to attribute credite to any of their promises, except he were weary of his life and welfare? For if they haue in this sort disceyued the most notablest & chiefest Lords of the coun∣trie, if they haue so cruelly without reason mur¦thered the Ambassadours sent by the Gouernāt & nobles to the king: and if they haue not kept promise with those towns which neuer resisted nor altered religion, if they haue bene so vn∣faithful to their owne souldiours, through whō they were become Maisters of the Country. Should we then whom they vtterly hate, (& as they say,) haue rebelled against the king, main∣taining (as they alleage) the Lutheriā doctrine, bene their mortall enimies, and effectually de∣clared the same, be kept promise with, then surely the world had néede be altered and newe changed.

But we perceiue euidently by their owne words, that they neuer meane to do it, for they themselues do not offer any assurance for ac∣complishmēt of their promise, but onely charge them of Amsterdam to giue notice therof to ye other townes, & in their behalf to promise this. Seing (saieth the Duke of Alba) that we do pro∣mise and assure you by this letter signed by vs
Page  [unnumbered]
that so it shalbe doon &c. Now wold they haue the towne of Amsterdam wholy take vpon hir to do that, which so many townes should here∣after bewayl & lament if they kepe not promise with them. It might afterwards be said: wher∣fore were thei so foolish as to credite thē of Am∣sterdam (their enimies) seing the Duke him self made them no promise? In conclusion it is no∣torious, that these be but meere disceiptes to disceiue the simple people, for the proper words of the letter do declare euidently, that ye Duke doth not assure or promise the Townes any thing, so that they cannot charge him with any promise, though he obserue nothing, but onely them of Amsterdam, who haue promised it on ye Dukes behalfe. And thinke you that they of Amsterdam haue their excuse to séeke? No I warrant you: for they may say, we haue not broken our promise, seing we haue not on our owne behalfe, but in the Dukes name onely promised you. This disceipt was plainely séene by the aboue rehersed souldiours of Valencien, for the Duke of Alba did make the promise, & the Countie Lodron brake it, and yet neither of both thought they cōmitted any offence herein, seing the one was not bound to perfourme that which he had not promised, & the other woulde not by his promise bynd the Coūtie of Lodron.

Page  [unnumbered]
All this nothwithstāding, though they should by any maner of othes or bonds, (possible to be deuised) confirme any promise, yit would they think thēselues in no point boūd to performe ye same, bicause of their cōmon rule: saying, there is no faith to be kept wt heretiks: as in the coū∣cel of Cōstance (wheras Iohannes Hus & Hierome of Prage, who vpō the kings oth & letters of safe conduct came thither & were there burnt aliue) it was cōcluded for an article of the faith, & all they condemned as heretickes, which kept any promise with heretiks. Besides yt, the Pope of Rome can at all times absolue thē of their othes & promise, as dayly it is vsed, so as they be no more bound to the same, than if they had neuer spoken it. Therfore, no wise people wilbe sedu∣ced with such deceitfull lies, but rather to ye last drop of their blood, duly & manfully helpe to de∣liuer their natiue coūtrie from these bloudthir∣sty Tyrants.

Lastly, they produce a newe trick, séeking to make those afraid which are fearfull & of small courage saying, that they greatly erre which think to withstand the kings power, and that it will fall out euil with them, if they remayne ob∣stinat and wil trie his maiesties power and force. First we haue protested & by these presents doe proteste, that we neuer did nor will withstand
Page  [unnumbered]
the kings power. Likewise are we well assu∣red that our king according to his accustomed clemētie, would not vse his power & force to de¦stroy & bring to ruine his own subiects, which always haue ben so faithfull to him & his aun∣cestors: But these straūge tirants which vnder the kings name goe about to bring our natiue countrie vnder their subiectiō, those wil we re∣siste to the vttermost and last man. And as for their power (wherof they so much hoast) we no∣thing feare, neither it néedeth not yt we tary lōg to trie their force, who haue alredy for ye space of v. or vi. yeres sufficiently shewed the same: so as they now scarce know whither to run or winde thēselues, and therfore come they nowe with this their pardon, perceyuing their force not to preuaile. But before, whē all things wēt as they wished, thei séemed as though thei wold haue deuoured the countrie in one minut. And perceyuing that the straunge souldiours (which serue only for money) ran from their garrisons they thought all had ben finished & done, and so wrote both into Spayne & Duytchland. But now being come to those that offer resistence, & are determined to defende their liberties with the sword: it quickly appeared through God his pro¦uidence, what their power was. For then they lost their best Captaynes and Souldiours, and
Page  [unnumbered]
the Lord God hath defended our iust cause, and made a scorne of their great power and force. Their old Spanish souldiours (the like of whom they thought were not in the world) remayned there slain aswel as ye other. And now thei haue tryed that there be men left in the world yt will fight for their natiue countrie. So that we (con∣tinuing in the feare of God, & perfect vnitie a∣mongst our selues) shall haue no néede to feare the haultie words of those who haue so long beatē their braynes against the weakest town in Holland, wherin at the first was neither store of vittuals, munitiō, nor souldiours, (and wher¦of they had so great an aduantage by reason of the Yse, that they accounted it a Towne of no force) are yit driuen backward, & come to shame and confusion. But now, séeing the water is o∣pen, and the towne (through GOD his grace) greatly strengthened and furnished of good sol∣diours, and al maner of good prouision and mu∣nition, think they to make vs afeard with their boasts and threatnings? Nay, nay, good Bur∣gesis, let vs be of good courage, and nothing re∣garde their bragges, but trust in the Lord our God, who hitherto hath so wonderfully assisted vs, defending our natiue Countrie to the vtter∣most with our substance & bloud. Let vs man∣fully stand in defence of our Wyues & children
Page  [unnumbered]
against these bloudthirstie enimies of our ho∣nors & cōmon weale: & to ye end direct our liues in all vnion & cōcord, to the intent that we may enioye our old liberties and priuileges, & leaue them behind vs, togither with a good name and fame to our childrens children, our neighbours and friends. Surely trusting in God, that hée will once turne his wrath from our sinnes, and behold vs with his mercifull countenance, and reduce our poore oppressed coūtrie to his former state and prosperitie. Also we trust that the Kings Ma. our soueraing Lord, piteously consi∣dering this insupportable tirāny & force, of those which so proudly abuse his name & title, to the destruction of the coūtrie dayly more and more: wil of his natural clemencie graunt vs, that we being deliuered frō these tyrants & suppressors, may once effectually shew, and apparantly de∣clare the iuste faith, hartie affection and seruiti∣able obedience, which we are readie (euen to the death) to shewe to his Maiestie, which wée in all humble maner require of his Maiestie. Also we hartely pray vnto almightie God, that he will graunt his Maiestie a long and healthful lyfe, & prosperous raigne. Written at Delft, the xii. of March. Anno 1573.
