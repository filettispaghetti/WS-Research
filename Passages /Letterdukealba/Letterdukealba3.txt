they pretended) did hereby schoole the King, and wold limit and set him orders at their pleasures: which by no meanes was to be suffred, for that ye same did tend to an open rebelliō; with many other like persuasions which they by night and daye propound to the Kyng, to the intent to incense him a∣gainst the lowe countries. Whereas their pretence was none other than to satisfie their vnsatiable auarice, & gréeued them yt they were barred from the handling of the money. This notwithstanding they haue since attributed the miserie of this Coun∣trie, which through their vnreasonable ty∣ranny is now happened, vnto the request of nine yeares. So as it is easely to be per∣ceiued yt they are those which wt their fay∣ned tales and false persuasions haue gone about to set debate and strife betwéene the Kyng and his faithfull subiects: which also did long before sufficiently appéere, in the time of the most noble Emperous Charles, for to the intent they might come to their pretence, and bring into the Countrie such placards vnder pretence of Religion, wher¦by they might be Masters of our goods and substances, yea ouer our liues, wyues and
Page  [unnumbered]
children, they with false illusions did per∣suade the good Emperour, that the doctrine of Martin Luther did condemne all iurisdi∣ctions both spirituall and temporall, and did giue free libertie to all men to robbe, murther, and burne, and euery one to liue at his frée libertie: as is expressed in the Emperours placard published at Wormes in Anno 22. and since in these lowe countries. Through occasion whereof, so much inno∣cent blood hath bene shed in these lowe coū∣tries, as it is to be verified, that since that time to this day, there hath bene executed for their conscience sake, some with the swoord, gallowes, fyre, and water, aboue one hunderd thousand persons, all vnder pretence that they were followers of such peruerse doctrine as in the sayd placard is inuented. Who séeth not than openly that they with manifest lies and open vntrueth do séeke to destroy and bring althings vn∣der their subiection? Haue we not also séene of late in the proponing of the tenth penie, how they haue helped thēselues with false practises? For when they perceyued that they could not persuade the states and the Deputies of the townes to condiscend, they
Page  [unnumbered]
declared they sawe euidently that it was not to be done, and therfore was it not their intent effectually to leuie the tenth penie as they had proponed: but yet to the intent they should shew their dutiful affection and inclination towardes his Maiestie, they re∣quested that it might be graunted vppon condicion, notwithstanding that it shoulde neuer be leuied nor put in execution. And hereof haue they giuen to the states of He∣naulde and some others, further actes and letters. This notwithstanding, they haue since by a méere force vrged the execution of the tenth penie, bycause they had written to the King of Spaine (as they said) that the same was graunted. These are the false & double pranckes, which they vse and séeke, therby to bring this coūtrie into the kyngs displeasure, and so finally to vtter ruine. Yea we sée that they in this their letter can not forget their wicked trickes and false lies, saying that we seeke to bring the tow∣nes from the true obediēce of his Maiestie, and to allure them to vs as wee haue done. They them selues doe certainely knowe that neither our meaning nor intēt is such, nor neuer was, as appereth, by all our
Page  [unnumbered]
writings, reasons, protestations, yea by al our actes, workes and proceedings. Yea, so farre it is from vs, that there is not one towne or village, no not one man to bée found, which is escaped from these strange tyrants, but he doth acknowledge the king for his Lord, and wilbe obedient vnto him in all respects, and likewise will spend his life & goods in his seruice, yea with a more feruentie than euer before: which they shalbe readie to shew effectually, so sone as it shall please the Kyngs Maiestie to dis∣charge them of this insupportable yoke and tirannie. So that it is moste euident that we haue not diuerted any townes frō the Kyngs obeysance, nor séeke to doe, but to the contrary, they are those that vnder the pretence and shadowe of the kyngs name, doth practise to get them from the kynges obeysance into theirs, to the intent to exer∣cise their force and tiranny ouer them.

Do we not sée how they haue brought a great part of Sapine from the kyngs obe∣dience vnder the subiection of the inquisiti∣on? So that they alone do rule and go∣ouerne ouer Uillages, Lordships, townes, and Countries, without acknowledging
Page  [unnumbered]
the Kyng: Yea they haue already so play∣ed their partes within the kyngdome of Spaine, that neither burgesse, commoner, nor noble man, no not the king himselfe, dare doo any thing against the authoritie & force of the Inquisition. They haue their Courtes, their Officers, Promoters, Ser∣ieants, Spies, Traitors, and Familiars, which will be subiect neither to the kings nor their countries iurisdiction, in so much that they are estéemed and feared more thā the king: like as hath appéered sufficiently by some great personages not necessary to be named, and yit daily doth among the no∣ble men and burgesses, whom they daily apprehend & put to death, without hauing regard to the kings superioritie or custome of the land. This is the gouernment which they would faine bring into this country, the which bicause we withstand, we are termed rebelles, as if we did withstand our king. Hereby they giue openly to vnder∣stand, that they seeke to ascribe the kingly name vnto themselues: knowing wel that we haue not stirred against the king, but against their outragious tiranny, which we will maintaine so long as one drop of
Page  [unnumbered]
blood remaineth in vs.

And yet further doe they procéede with their Spanishe prankes, rehearsing here some Townes which they (to get them the more credit) haue left vnspoiled, alleadging that they haue spared all those which haue offered no defence, concluding thereby that to all those which would willingly giue themselues vnder their subiection (which they terme the Kings obeysance) no harme should be offered. Nowe, it appéereth eui∣dently, that all the Townes (in this Letter comprehended) haue already sufficiently declared, what their meaning and intent is, namely to withstand the tirannie of these blood suckers, and that to the vtter∣most: and to that intent did willingly re∣ceyue garrisons of Souldious: but being forsaken of those garrisons, and being not able any longer to resist, the Burgeses did surrender themselues into the handes of those whom they tooke for their enemies. Haue now the Spanards of remorce and pi∣tie spared those Townes, as they would fayne make vs beléeue? What occasion had they thē before or since to set on fire so ma∣ny faire places and Uillages in the Coun∣trie?
Page  [unnumbered]
who neuer hurt them: and althoughs thei would yit could not offer any resistēce. Why haue they chased so many a poore mā out of his possession, destroying his house & grounde? Yea, what occasion had they to shewe themselues so cruell and furious a∣gainst the Towne of Machlin? sparinge neither Churches nor Cloisters, but made hauoke of all to the vttermost. Did not they of Machlin surrender them selues so soone as the garrison was departed out of the Towne? it is manifest, yes. And that which is more, they neuer would suffer a∣ny alteration of Religion, nor yit permit any preaching of the Gospell. What hath all this profited them against the gryping handes of these mercifull giuers of pardō? The like hath happened to Dirmonde and Audenaerde, whom they first put to raun∣some, and yit afterwards vtterly spoyled and sacked. Ouer and besides this, the Towne of Mons in Henaulde was taken in by force: the Commons whereof would neyther assiste nor helpe the Souldiours to defende the Towne against the Albanistes, (which since they haue repented) nor yet would permit any alteration in Religion.
Page  [unnumbered]
Which Towne was afterwards agayne surrendred by composition into the Duke of Alba his handes, vppon promise by othe & letters, that none of the Burgeses should be harmed: which promise notwithstan∣ding, whē they were entred, and al things as they would haue it, hanged vp a num∣ber of them, and God knoweth howe the rest shall spéede.

And here in Hollande, how haue they v∣sed them of Rotterdam, who neuer were re∣uolted from them, nor yit had commenced any alteration either of religion or gouern¦ment? yea neuer thought of it: and yit at their ioyfull, haue they not murthered the Burgesses in great number, contrary to their promise? And afterwards at their de∣parture out of the towne, had not they con∣cluded to set it on fire, the most part of thē being departed? to which purpose they had prouided a great deale of straw and other stuffe, and would haue brought it to passe in déede, if the Bailife and other good Bur∣gesses had not letted them, who perceiuing themselues to be the stronger party, began to take some courage, & to withstand them.

Note further I pray you what faith or
Page  [unnumbered]
credite is to be giuē to their promise which they vowe so surely, as maye be séene by the horrible murther committed by these bloudie houndes at Naerden neare vnto Harlem: where vppon like promise made (as aforesayd) the Burgesses of the Citie suffered, them to enter, vppon hope of safety of life and goodes. The Spaniardes being entred, caused the Borowmaster and the commōs to resort to a certaine great house standing on the market place, vnder pre∣tence to sweare them to be true to the king. The poore simple people hauing dispossessed themselues of their armour and weapons, comming to ye place appoynted, were there like a sort of Lambes most cruelly murthe∣red, in such sort as few escaped. One Cor∣nelius Gissebert being then Borowmaster, was murdred by ye hāds of ye Duke of Al∣baes owne son, & many of their daughters they rauished in presence of the dead carca∣ses. Not contented with this, they ranne to the other Borowmasters house, where finding him sicke in his bead, murthered him. Besides this they spared not so much as the poore impotent persons that they foūd in the hospitall, with other most execrable
Page  [unnumbered]
déedes, as hanging vp of men by the priuie members, and women by their brestes. &c. Which outragious crueltie there commit∣ted was (as they themselues confesse) ye oc∣casion of their euill successe at Harlem, al∣leaging the words of Iudas, Peccaui, tra∣dens sanguinem iustum. And a certaine Spaniard taken before Harlem, before his death confessed, they thought to haue done the like at Harlem.

These things considered, is there any to be found so foolish and madde, that would giue credite to their wordes? and suppose with himselfe, that they haue spared the townes for pitie and holinesse? Wheras it is euident, that such Townes as at their first entrie they did not altogither spoyle & ransacke: haue afterwardes bene so bur∣thened and raunsomed▪ as men haue bene forced to pay thrée times the vallue of their houses and goods. And now they declare, that they do intend to shew the like grace as is aforesaid, vnto the other townes in Holland, which henceforth wil of their own accord yéeld themselues to their obeysance. Certainly the grace wilbe great that they will shew, they will for a time dissemble
Page  [unnumbered]
the mater and looke through the fingers, vn¦till such time as they shalbe masters of the Townes, and then at their pleasure will apprehend and lay hold sometimes of one dosen here, somtimes of another dosen there, of the chiefest and substantialest, and as they sée oportunitie cause thē to be hang∣ed vp: which wilbe thought by them a singu¦lar grace in so eschaping from being bur∣ned aliue. And so hauing all the other Townes likewise vnder their subiection, their crueltie will then first begin: for then will they build Bulworkes and Castels in all firme townes, and begin to take and ap∣prehend the poore Burgesses by heapes, sending some with Galleyes into Spaine, some to be sold as slaues, other to be hanged on trées and Gallowes, and so vsed as a sort of shéepe brought to ye shambels. Then followeth the displacing of Magestrates & rulers, taking away of priuileges, deui∣ding the gouernment amongst Spaniards and Italians, bringing in the bloudie coun∣sell, and Inquisition, which is ten tymes worse than it hath bene vsed in Spaine, ex∣acting the twentie, and the tenth, yea the fifth and the third penie, and so fulfill their
Page  [unnumbered]
appetites vppon our goods, yea, with our wyues and daughters: to conculde to bring the whole countrie vnder the miserablest slauerie that euer hath bene heard of. This sure is the grace that they of their meere mercy thinke to vse, for what grace or mer∣cy is there otherwise to be loked for at their hands, if they should become victorious o∣uer ye coūtrie as ouer their enimies, & reco¦uer those townes which haue reiected their yoke? séeing they haue vsed such cruel tirā∣ny, oultrage & insolentie in those townes, which at the first haue as friendes receiued them, and shewed them all friendshippe, helpe and assistaunce. Enquire of ye townes of Maestricht, Shertoghenbosch, Wtrecht, Tourney, Valencien, Lyle, and other more where they haue lyen in garrison, what grace they haue there extended towardes the commons of the same? And whither there be any kynd of oultrage, insolentie, spite or crueltie to be deuised, which there hath not bene vsed? So as many of their commons haue in great nombers bene pi∣teously murthered, as within the townes of Lyle, Valencien, and Tourney, hath notori∣ously
Page  [unnumbered]
ben séene, and would haue set on fire and spoiled diuers of the notablest townes, as we haue rehearsed of Rotterdam, and as was aparant at Wtrecht, where they were determined to haue done ye like. Yea let vs sée how they haue done at Amsterdamme, (which Towne was well affectioned to∣wards them). Let vs consider what good fruites they of Amsterdam haue reaped by it. These haue first exacted of them a hun∣dreth thousand Gilderns, vppon condition to haue no Souldiours: afterwardes, they were the first that were condemned in the payment of the tenth penie, and cōsequent∣ly haue so charged and burdened them, that the Towne is in a manner vndone.

But for what respect will they be so fa∣uourable and mercyfull to our Countrie, to graunt this fauour towards vs? It must procéede either in respect of our persons, or theirs. As touching their owne persones, they muste be moued to it of nature, or in respect of their gayne and profit. It is no∣torious that of nature they ar not enclined to mercy or kindnesse to vse such singular grace towardes vs. For if men consider what cruell and inhumain factes they haue
Page  [unnumbered]
committed in the kingdom of Naples, with in the Dukedome of Milan, in the Indies, and in all partes of these lowe Countries where they are become vanquishers: yea in their own natiue Countrie, by robbing, murthering, burning, rauishing of womē, cutting of childrē out of their mothers bel∣lies and such like abhominable déedes, vn∣der the colour of rebellion & heresie (which they alwayes alledge for them selues) no occasion wilbe therby found why any man might accompt them pitiful and gratious. Then this their pitie and mercye muste procéed out of a respect for their own gayn. But that can not be, for they think that the Townes which are declined from them, haue so done, bicause they did not vse suffi∣cient crueltie against them, but spared ma∣ny which now are become their chéefe ene∣mies, according to the prouerbe which their Vargas doth vse, Nimis magna clementia, nos perdidit:* that is to saye, Too much mercy, hath spilled vs. Now therefore they make their rekoning thus, that if they may once againe obtaine to be Maisters, they will so tame and yoke the Countrie, that thei shal not néede to be at great trauell or charges
Page  [unnumbered]
to kéepe the inhabitants therof vnder their subiection.

Nowe, séeing wée can not expect any mercy or fauour at their hands for respect of their persones? Let vs then sée whither they might be thereunto moued for respect of ours: certainly much lesse. For, besides that the Spanish Nation are of nature lof∣ty and proud, and doe contemne all other Nations, séeking the superioritie ouer all, they do beare a singular and priuie hatred against this our Nation of the lowe coun∣tries: which hatred (as commonly it is séene) is bred of a ielousie. For they séeing that our naturall Princes and Lordes, the Dukes of Brabāt & Earles of Holland, &c. haue matched and allied them selues with Spanish women, heires of the kingdomes of Spaine, and by that meanes obtayninge the gouernement ouer them, sometimes haue ordeyned Netherlanders to rule in ye regiment of Spayne: as in the time of the Lord of Cheures, and the Cardinal Adrian borne in Hollande (who afterward was e∣lected Pope of Rome) hath ben séene. This hath not a little gréeued ye Spaniards, that they should be ruled by Flemings, (for so thei
Page  [unnumbered]
terme all the Netherlanders) And hereout it happened, that within a whyle after that Charles the Emperour (of noble memorie) as lawfull heire did succede his Grandfa∣ther Ferdinandus king of Spayne, the whole countrie of Spaine, especially the kingdome of Arragon, began to rebell against Charles their naturall Lord, wrongfully pretēding that the succession of the kingdome belon∣ged not vnto him, and to that ende sent for a certaine Duke of Calabria, which was of the auncient house of Arragon, who then laye in prison, offering him the kingdome: which he denied to accept.

Notwithstanding, shortly after, by the good fortune and pollicie of the Emperour Charles, all those matters were brought to a quiet ende: yit euer since that time haue the Spaniards borne an inward grudge & malice against our nation, as they haue al∣wayes well declared when soeuer they had any oportunitie, but especially against the Nobles of the Countrie, whom they per∣ceyued to be in speciall grace and fauour with the Emperour Charles (of most fa∣mous memorie) and the Kinges Maiestie that now is, inuēting al maner of meanes
Page  [unnumbered]
to bring these Countries into the displea∣sure of their Maiesties: which (besides the examples aforesaid) doth euidently appéere by this last proposition of the Emperour Charles, who departing out of these Coun∣tries towards Spayne, leauing the same to his Sonne our soueraigne Lord, saide: hée did sufficiently perceyue, that the Spaniards sought by all meanes to incense him, and bring into his hatred his subiects of ye lowe Countries, according to their accustomed enuious nature which they bare towardes the countrie, but he should not credit them: but to the contrarie, hold these Countries for speciall recommended, as those who in his most necessitie (aboue all others) had de∣clared towards him most obedient faythe∣fulnesse, and had reserued the Crowne on his head: requesting they would shewe the like towards their yong King, and that hée should minister Iustice to all men, accor∣ding to reason, defending them against the rigour and violēce of their enemies, with∣out giuing credit to their euill willers and aduersaries, with many other holsome ad∣monitions, which some Lordes presently liuing, heard him speake.
