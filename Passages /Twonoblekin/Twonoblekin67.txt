SECOND FRIEND, [aside]  How he looks!

JAILER
This morning.

WOOER  Was she well? Was she in health?
Sir, when did she sleep?

FIRST FRIEND, [aside]  These are strange questions.

JAILER
I do not think she was very well--for now
You make me mind her; but this very day
I asked her questions, and she answered me
So far from what she was, so childishly,
So sillily, as if she were a fool,
An innocent, and I was very angry.
But what of her, sir?

WOOER  Nothing but my pity;
But you must know it, and as good by me
As by another that less loves her.

JAILER  Well, sir?

WOOER
No, sir, not well.

FIRST FRIEND  Not right?

SECOND FRIEND  Not well?

WOOER
'Tis too true; she is mad.

FIRST FRIEND  It cannot be.

WOOER
Believe you'll find it so.

JAILER  I half suspected
What you told me. The gods comfort her!
Either this was her love to Palamon,
Or fear of my miscarrying on his 'scape,
Or both.

WOOER  'Tis likely.

JAILER  But why all this haste, sir?
