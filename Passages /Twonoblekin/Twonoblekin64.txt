With all our souls.

THESEUS  He that she refuses
Must die then.

BOTH  Any death thou canst invent, duke.

PALAMON
If I fall from that mouth, I fall with favor,
And lovers yet unborn shall bless my ashes.

ARCITE
If she refuse me, yet my grave will wed me,
And soldiers sing my epitaph.

THESEUS, [to Emilia]  Make choice, then.

EMILIA
I cannot, sir; they are both too excellent.
For me, a hair shall never fall of these men.

HIPPOLYTA
What will become of 'em?

THESEUS  Thus I ordain it--
And, by mine honor, once again, it stands,
Or both shall die: you shall both to your country,
And each within this month, accompanied
With three fair knights, appear again in this place,
In which I'll plant a pyramid; and whether,
Before us that are here, can force his cousin
By fair and knightly strength to touch the pillar,
He shall enjoy her; the other lose his head,
And all his friends; nor shall he grudge to fall,
Nor think he dies with interest in this lady.
Will this content you?

PALAMON  Yes.--Here, Cousin Arcite,
I am friends again till that hour.	[He offers his hand.]

ARCITE  I embrace you.
[They shake hands.]

THESEUS
Are you content, sister?

EMILIA  Yes, I must, sir,
Else both miscarry.

THESEUS, [to Palamon and Arcite]
