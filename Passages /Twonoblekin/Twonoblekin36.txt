
ARCITE  This; but far off, prince.

THESEUS
Are you a gentleman?

ARCITE  My father said so,
And to those gentle uses gave me life.

THESEUS
Are you his heir?

ARCITE  His youngest, sir.

THESEUS  Your father,
Sure, is a happy sire, then. What proves you?

ARCITE
A little of all noble qualities.
I could have kept a hawk and well have hallowed
To a deep cry of dogs. I dare not praise
My feat in horsemanship, yet they that knew me
Would say it was my best piece. Last, and greatest,
I would be thought a soldier.

THESEUS  You are perfect.

PIRITHOUS
Upon my soul, a proper man.

EMILIA  He is so.

PIRITHOUS, [to Hippolyta]
How do you like him, lady?

HIPPOLYTA  I admire him.
I have not seen so young a man so noble,
If he say true, of his sort.

EMILIA  Believe,
His mother was a wondrous handsome woman;
His face, methinks, goes that way.

HIPPOLYTA  But his body
And fiery mind illustrate a brave father.

PIRITHOUS
Mark how his virtue, like a hidden sun,
Breaks through his baser garments.
