Her twinning cherries shall their sweetness fall
Upon thy tasteful lips, what wilt thou think
Of rotten kings or blubbered queens? What care
For what thou feel'st not, what thou feel'st being
able
To make Mars spurn his drum? O, if thou couch
But one night with her, every hour in 't will
Take hostage of thee for a hundred, and
Thou shalt remember nothing more than what
That banquet bids thee to.

HIPPOLYTA, [to Theseus]  Though much unlike
You should be so transported, as much sorry
I should be such a suitor, yet I think
Did I not, by th' abstaining of my joy--
Which breeds a deeper longing--cure their surfeit
That craves a present med'cine, I should pluck
All ladies' scandal on me.	[She kneels.]
Therefore, sir,
As I shall here make trial of my prayers,
Either presuming them to have some force,
Or sentencing for aye their vigor dumb,
Prorogue this business we are going about, and
hang
Your shield afore your heart--about that neck
Which is my fee, and which I freely lend
To do these poor queens service.

ALL QUEENS, [to Emilia]  O, help now!
Our cause cries for your knee.

EMILIA, [to Theseus, kneeling]  If you grant not
My sister her petition in that force,
With that celerity and nature which
She makes it in, from henceforth I'll not dare
To ask you anything, nor be so hardy
Ever to take a husband.

THESEUS  Pray stand up.
[Hippolyta and Emilia rise.]
I am entreating of myself to do
That which you kneel to have me.--Pirithous,
Lead on the bride; get you and pray the gods
For success and return; omit not anything
In the pretended celebration.--Queens,
Follow your soldier. [To Artesius.] As before, hence
you,
And at the banks of Aulis meet us with
The forces you can raise, where we shall find
The moiety of a number for a business
