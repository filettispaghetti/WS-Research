
ARCITE  You care not for a grand guard?

PALAMON
No, no, we'll use no horses. I perceive
You would fain be at that fight.

ARCITE  I am indifferent.

PALAMON
Faith, so am I. Good cousin, thrust the buckle
Through far enough.

ARCITE  I warrant you.

PALAMON  My casque now.

ARCITE
Will you fight bare-armed?

PALAMON  We shall be the nimbler.

ARCITE
But use your gauntlets though. Those are o' th' least.
Prithee take mine, good cousin.

PALAMON  Thank you, Arcite.
How do I look? Am I fall'n much away?

ARCITE
Faith, very little; love has used you kindly.

PALAMON
I'll warrant thee, I'll strike home.

ARCITE  Do, and spare not.
I'll give you cause, sweet cousin.

PALAMON  Now to you, sir.
[He begins to arm Arcite.]
Methinks this armor's very like that, Arcite,
Thou wor'st that day the three kings fell, but lighter.

ARCITE
That was a very good one, and that day,
I well remember, you outdid me, cousin.
I never saw such valor. When you charged
Upon the left wing of the enemy,
I spurred hard to come up, and under me
I had a right good horse.
