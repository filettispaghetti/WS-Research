
EMILIA, [to Woman]
Canst not thou work such flowers in silk, wench?

WOMAN  Yes.

EMILIA
I'll have a gown full of 'em, and of these.
This is pretty color. Will 't not do
Rarely upon a skirt, wench?

WOMAN  Dainty, madam.

ARCITE, [to Palamon]
Cousin, cousin! How do you, sir? Why, Palamon!

PALAMON
Never till now I was in prison, Arcite.

ARCITE
Why, what's the matter, man?

PALAMON  Behold, and wonder!
By heaven, she is a goddess.

ARCITE, [seeing Emilia]  Ha!

PALAMON  Do reverence.
She is a goddess, Arcite.

EMILIA, [to Woman]  Of all flowers
Methinks a rose is best.

WOMAN  Why, gentle madam?

EMILIA
It is the very emblem of a maid.
For when the west wind courts her gently,
How modestly she blows and paints the sun
With her chaste blushes! When the north comes
near her,
Rude and impatient, then, like chastity,
She locks her beauties in her bud again,
And leaves him to base briers.

WOMAN  Yet, good madam,
Sometimes her modesty will blow so far
She falls for 't. A maid,
If she have any honor, would be loath
To take example by her.
