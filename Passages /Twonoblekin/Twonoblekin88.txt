DOCTOR, [aside]  What stuff she utters!

[Wooer and Doctor come forward.]



JAILER
Make curtsy; here your love comes.

WOOER  Pretty soul,
How do you?	[Daughter curtsies.]
That's a fine maid; there's a curtsy!

DAUGHTER
Yours to command i' th' way of honesty.--
How far is 't now to th' end o' th' world, my masters?

DOCTOR
Why, a day's journey, wench.

DAUGHTER, [to Wooer]  Will you go with me?

WOOER
What shall we do there, wench?

DAUGHTER  Why, play at
stool-ball.
What is there else to do?

WOOER  I am content,
If we shall keep our wedding there.

DAUGHTER  'Tis true,
For there, I will assure you, we shall find
Some blind priest for the purpose, that will venture
To marry us; for here they are nice and foolish.
Besides, my father must be hanged tomorrow,
And that would be a blot i' th' business.
Are not you Palamon?

WOOER  Do not you know me?

DAUGHTER
Yes, but you care not for me; I have nothing
But this poor petticoat and two coarse smocks.

WOOER
That's all one; I will have you.

DAUGHTER  Will you surely?
