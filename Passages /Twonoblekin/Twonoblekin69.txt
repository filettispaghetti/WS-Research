And then she wept, and sung again, and sighed,
And with the same breath smiled and kissed her
hand.

SECOND FRIEND
Alas, what pity it is!

WOOER  I made in to her.
She saw me, and straight sought the flood. I saved
her
And set her safe to land, when presently
She slipped away, and to the city made
With such a cry and swiftness that, believe me,
She left me far behind her. Three or four
I saw from far off cross her--one of 'em
I knew to be your brother--where she stayed
And fell, scarce to be got away. I left them with her
And hither came to tell you.

[Enter Jailer's Brother, Jailer's Daughter, and others.]

Here they are.

DAUGHTER, [sings]
	May you never more enjoy the light, etc.
Is not this a fine song?

BROTHER  O, a very fine one.

DAUGHTER  I can sing twenty more.

BROTHER  I think you can.

DAUGHTER  Yes, truly can I. I can sing "The Broom"
and "Bonny Robin." Are not you a tailor?

BROTHER  Yes.

DAUGHTER  Where's my wedding gown?

BROTHER  I'll bring it tomorrow.

DAUGHTER  Do, very rarely, I must be abroad else to
call the maids and pay the minstrels, for I must
lose my maidenhead by cocklight. 'Twill never
thrive else.
[Sings.]O fair, O sweet, etc.

BROTHER, [to Jailer]  You must e'en take it patiently.
