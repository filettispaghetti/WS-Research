Be of good comfort, man; I bring you news,
Good news.

JAILER  They are welcome.

SECOND FRIEND  Palamon has cleared
you
And got your pardon, and discovered how
And by whose means he escaped, which was your
daughter's,
Whose pardon is procured too; and the prisoner,
Not to be held ungrateful to her goodness,
Has given a sum of money to her marriage--
A large one, I'll assure you.

JAILER  You are a good man
And ever bring good news.

FIRST FRIEND  How was it ended?

SECOND FRIEND
Why, as it should be: they that ne'er begged
But they prevailed had their suits fairly granted;
The prisoners have their lives.

FIRST FRIEND  I knew 'twould be so.

SECOND FRIEND
But there be new conditions, which you'll hear of
At better time.

JAILER  I hope they are good.

SECOND FRIEND  They are
honorable;
How good they'll prove I know not.

FIRST FRIEND  'Twill be known.

[Enter Wooer.]


WOOER
Alas, sir, where's your daughter?

JAILER  Why do you ask?

WOOER
O, sir, when did you see her?
