
WOOER, [taking her hand]
Yes, by this fair hand, will I.

DAUGHTER  We'll to bed then.

WOOER
E'en when you will.	[He kisses her.]

DAUGHTER, [wiping her face]  O , sir, you would fain
be nibbling.

WOOER
Why do you rub my kiss off?

DAUGHTER  'Tis a sweet one,
And will perfume me finely against the wedding.
Is not this your cousin Arcite?	[She indicates Doctor.]

DOCTOR  Yes, sweetheart,
And I am glad my cousin Palamon
Has made so fair a choice.

DAUGHTER  Do you think he'll have me?

DOCTOR
Yes, without doubt.

DAUGHTER, [to Jailer]  Do you think so too?

JAILER  Yes.

DAUGHTER
We shall have many children. [(To Doctor.)] Lord,
how you're grown!
My Palamon, I hope, will grow too, finely,
Now he's at liberty. Alas, poor chicken,
He was kept down with hard meat and ill lodging,
But I'll kiss him up again.

[Enter a Messenger.]


MESSENGER
What do you here? You'll lose the noblest sight
That e'er was seen.

JAILER  Are they i' th' field?

MESSENGER  They are.
