And this the noble body. I am sotted,
Utterly lost. My virgin's faith has fled me.
For if my brother but even now had asked me
Whether I loved, I had run mad for Arcite.
Now, if my sister, more for Palamon.
Stand both together. Now, come ask me, brother.
Alas, I know not! Ask me now, sweet sister.
I may go look! What a mere child is Fancy,
That, having two fair gauds of equal sweetness,
Cannot distinguish, but must cry for both.

[Enter a Gentleman.]

How now, sir?

GENTLEMAN  From the noble duke, your brother,
Madam, I bring you news: the knights are come.

EMILIA
To end the quarrel?

GENTLEMAN  Yes.

EMILIA  Would I might end first!
What sins have I committed, chaste Diana,
That my unspotted youth must now be soiled
With blood of princes, and my chastity
Be made the altar where the lives of lovers--
Two greater and two better never yet
Made mothers joy--must be the sacrifice
To my unhappy beauty?

[Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous and Attendants.]


THESEUS, [to Attendant]  Bring 'em in
Quickly, by any means; I long to see 'em.
[To Emilia.] Your two contending lovers are
returned,
And with them their fair knights. Now, my fair
sister,
You must love one of them.

EMILIA  I had rather both,
So neither for my sake should fall untimely.

THESEUS
Who saw 'em?

PIRITHOUS  I awhile.
