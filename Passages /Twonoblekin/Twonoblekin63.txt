For heaven's sake, save their lives, and banish 'em.

THESEUS
On what conditions?

EMILIA  Swear 'em never more
To make me their contention, or to know me,
To tread upon thy dukedom, and to be,
Wherever they shall travel, ever strangers
To one another.

PALAMON  I'll be cut a-pieces
Before I take this oath! Forget I love her?
O, all you gods, despise me then! Thy banishment
I not mislike, so we may fairly carry
Our swords and cause along; else never trifle,
But take our lives, duke. I must love, and will,
And for that love must and dare kill this cousin
On any piece the Earth has.

THESEUS  Will you, Arcite,
Take these conditions?

PALAMON  He's a villain, then.

PIRITHOUS  These are men!

ARCITE
No, never, duke. 'Tis worse to me than begging
To take my life so basely; though I think
I never shall enjoy her, yet I'll preserve
The honor of affection, and die for her,
Make death a devil!

THESEUS
What may be done? For now I feel compassion.

PIRITHOUS
Let it not fall again, sir.

THESEUS  Say, Emilia,
If one of them were dead, as one must, are you
Content to take th' other to your husband?
They cannot both enjoy you. They are princes
As goodly as your own eyes, and as noble
As ever fame yet spoke of. Look upon 'em,
And, if you can love, end this difference.
I give consent.--Are you content too, princes?

BOTH
