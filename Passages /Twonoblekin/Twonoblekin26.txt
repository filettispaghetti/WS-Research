
EMILIA  Thou art wanton!

ARCITE, [to Palamon]
She is wondrous fair.

PALAMON  She is all the beauty extant.

EMILIA, [to Woman]
The sun grows high. Let's walk in. Keep these
flowers.
We'll see how near art can come near their colors.
I am wondrous merry-hearted. I could laugh now.

WOMAN
I could lie down, I am sure.

EMILIA  And take one with you?

WOMAN
That's as we bargain, madam.

EMILIA  Well, agree then.
[Emilia and Woman exit.]

PALAMON
What think you of this beauty?

ARCITE  'Tis a rare one.

PALAMON
Is 't but a rare one?

ARCITE  Yes, a matchless beauty.

PALAMON
Might not a man well lose himself and love her?

ARCITE
I cannot tell what you have done; I have,
Beshrew mine eyes for 't! Now I feel my shackles.

PALAMON
You love her, then?

ARCITE  Who would not?

PALAMON  And desire her?

ARCITE
