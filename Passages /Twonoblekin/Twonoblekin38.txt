THESEUS, [to Hippolyta]  Sweet, you must be ready,--
And you, Emilia,--and you, friend,--and all,
Tomorrow by the sun, to do observance
To flowery May in Dian's wood.--Wait well, sir,
Upon your mistress.--Emily, I hope
He shall not go afoot.

EMILIA  That were a shame, sir,
While I have horses.--Take your choice, and what
You want at any time, let me but know it.
If you serve faithfully, I dare assure you
You'll find a loving mistress.

ARCITE  If I do not,
Let me find that my father ever hated,
Disgrace and blows.

THESEUS  Go lead the way; you have won it.
It shall be so; you shall receive all dues
Fit for the honor you have won. 'Twere wrong else.--
Sister, beshrew my heart, you have a servant
That, if I were a woman, would be master;
But you are wise.

EMILIA  I hope too wise for that, sir.
[Flourish. They all exit.]

[Enter Jailer's Daughter alone.]


DAUGHTER
Let all the dukes and all the devils roar!
He is at liberty. I have ventured for him,
And out I have brought him; to a little wood
A mile hence I have sent him, where a cedar
Higher than all the rest spreads like a plane
Fast by a brook, and there he shall keep close
Till I provide him files and food, for yet
His iron bracelets are not off. O Love,
What a stout-hearted child thou art! My father
Durst better have endured cold iron than done it.
I love him beyond love and beyond reason
Or wit or safety. I have made him know it;
I care not, I am desperate. If the law
Find me and then condemn me for 't, some wenches,
Some honest-hearted maids, will sing my dirge
And tell to memory my death was noble,
Dying almost a martyr. That way he takes
