HIPPOLYTA  He's well got, sure.

THESEUS, [to Arcite]
What made you seek this place, sir?

ARCITE  Noble Theseus,
To purchase name and do my ablest service
To such a well-found wonder as thy worth;
For only in thy court, of all the world,
Dwells fair-eyed Honor.

PIRITHOUS  All his words are worthy.

THESEUS
Sir, we are much indebted to your travel,
Nor shall you lose your wish.--Pirithous,
Dispose of this fair gentleman.

PIRITHOUS  Thanks, Theseus.--
Whate'er you are, you're mine, and I shall give you
To a most noble service: to this lady,
This bright young virgin.
[He brings Arcite to Emilia.]
Pray observe her goodness;
You have honored her fair birthday with your
virtues,
And, as your due, you're hers. Kiss her fair hand, sir.

ARCITE
Sir, you're a noble giver.--Dearest beauty,
Thus let me seal my vowed faith.
[He kisses her hand.]
When your servant,
Your most unworthy creature, but offends you,
Command him die, he shall.

EMILIA  That were too cruel.
If you deserve well, sir, I shall soon see 't.
You're mine, and somewhat better than your rank
I'll use you.

PIRITHOUS, [to Arcite]
I'll see you furnished, and because you say
You are a horseman, I must needs entreat you
This afternoon to ride--but 'tis a rough one.

ARCITE
I like him better, prince; I shall not then
Freeze in my saddle.
