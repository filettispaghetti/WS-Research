
PALAMON  You had, indeed;
A bright bay, I remember.

ARCITE  Yes, but all
Was vainly labored in me; you outwent me,
Nor could my wishes reach you; yet a little
I did by imitation.

PALAMON  More by virtue;
You are modest, cousin.

ARCITE  When I saw you charge first,
Methought I heard a dreadful clap of thunder
Break from the troop.

PALAMON  But still before that flew
The lightning of your valor. Stay a little;
Is not this piece too strait?

ARCITE  No, no, 'tis well.

PALAMON
I would have nothing hurt thee but my sword.
A bruise would be dishonor.

ARCITE  Now I am perfect.

PALAMON
Stand off, then.

ARCITE  Take my sword; I hold it better.

PALAMON
I thank you, no; keep it; your life lies on it.
Here's one; if it but hold, I ask no more
For all my hopes. My cause and honor guard me!

ARCITE
And me my love!
[They bow several ways, then advance and stand.]
Is there aught else to say?

PALAMON
This only, and no more: thou art mine aunt's son.
And that blood we desire to shed is mutual--
In me thine, and in thee mine. My sword
Is in my hand, and if thou kill'st me,
The gods and I forgive thee. If there be
A place prepared for those that sleep in honor,
