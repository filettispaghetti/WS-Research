PISTOL
Moy shall not serve; I will have forty moys;
Or I will fetch thy rim out at thy throat
In drops of crimson blood.
French Soldier
Est-il impossible d'echapper la force de ton bras?
PISTOL
Brass, cur!
Thou damned and luxurious mountain goat,
Offer'st me brass?
French Soldier
O pardonnez moi!
PISTOL
Say'st thou me so? is that a ton of moys?
Come hither, boy: ask me this slave in French
What is his name.
Boy
Ecoutez: comment etes-vous appele?
French Soldier
Monsieur le Fer.
Boy
He says his name is Master Fer.
PISTOL
Master Fer! I'll fer him, and firk him, and ferret
him: discuss the same in French unto him.
Boy
I do not know the French for fer, and ferret, and firk.
PISTOL
Bid him prepare; for I will cut his throat.
French Soldier
Que dit-il, monsieur?
Boy
Il me commande de vous dire que vous faites vous
pret; car ce soldat ici est dispose tout a cette
heure de couper votre gorge.
PISTOL
Owy, cuppele gorge, permafoy,
Peasant, unless thou give me crowns, brave crowns;
Or mangled shalt thou be by this my sword.
French Soldier
O, je vous supplie, pour l'amour de Dieu, me
pardonner! Je suis gentilhomme de bonne maison:
gardez ma vie, et je vous donnerai deux cents ecus.
PISTOL
What are his words?
Boy
He prays you to save his life: he is a gentleman of
a good house; and for his ransom he will give you
two hundred crowns.
