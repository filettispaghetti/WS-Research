affection: it is past the infinite of thought.
DON PEDRO
May be she doth but counterfeit.
CLAUDIO
Faith, like enough.
LEONATO
O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of
passion came so near the life of passion as she
discovers it.
DON PEDRO
Why, what effects of passion shows she?
CLAUDIO
Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.
LEONATO
What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heard
my daughter tell you how.
CLAUDIO
She did, indeed.
DON PEDRO
How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I
thought her spirit had been invincible against all
assaults of affection.
LEONATO
I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially
against Benedick.
BENEDICK
I should think this a gull, but that the
white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,
sure, hide himself in such reverence.
CLAUDIO
He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.
DON PEDRO
Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?
LEONATO
No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.
CLAUDIO
'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall
I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him
with scorn, write to him that I love him?'
LEONATO
This says she now when she is beginning to write to
him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and
there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a
sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.
CLAUDIO
Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a
pretty jest your daughter told us of.
LEONATO
O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she
found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?
