I have the toothache.
DON PEDRO
Draw it.
BENEDICK
Hang it!
CLAUDIO
You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.
DON PEDRO
What! sigh for the toothache?
LEONATO
Where is but a humour or a worm.
BENEDICK
Well, every one can master a grief but he that has
it.
CLAUDIO
Yet say I, he is in love.
DON PEDRO
There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be
a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be
a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the
shape of two countries at once, as, a German from
the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from
the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy
to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no
fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.
CLAUDIO
If he be not in love with some woman, there is no
believing old signs: a' brushes his hat o'
mornings; what should that bode?
DON PEDRO
Hath any man seen him at the barber's?
CLAUDIO
No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,
and the old ornament of his cheek hath already
stuffed tennis-balls.
LEONATO
Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.
DON PEDRO
Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him
out by that?
CLAUDIO
That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.
DON PEDRO
The greatest note of it is his melancholy.
CLAUDIO
And when was he wont to wash his face?
DON PEDRO
Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear
what they say of him.
CLAUDIO
