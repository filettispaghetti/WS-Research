LEONATO
What is he that you ask for, niece?
HERO
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
Messenger
O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.
BEATRICE

conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and
now is the whole man governed with one: so that if
he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him
bear it for a difference between himself and his
horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,
to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his
companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.
Messenger
Is't possible?
BEATRICE
Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as
