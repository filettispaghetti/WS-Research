Brother,--
ANTONIO
Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;
And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,
That dare as well answer a man indeed
As I dare take a serpent by the tongue:
Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!
LEONATO
Brother Antony,--
ANTONIO
Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,
And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,--
Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,
That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,
Go anticly, show outward hideousness,
And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,
How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;
And this is all.
LEONATO
But, brother Antony,--
ANTONIO
Come, 'tis no matter:
Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.
DON PEDRO
Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.
My heart is sorry for your daughter's death:
But, on my honour, she was charged with nothing
But what was true and very full of proof.
LEONATO
My lord, my lord,--
DON PEDRO
I will not hear you.
LEONATO
No? Come, brother; away! I will be heard.
ANTONIO
And shall, or some of us will smart for it.
Exeunt LEONATO and ANTONIO

DON PEDRO
See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.
Enter BENEDICK

CLAUDIO
Now, signior, what news?
BENEDICK
Good day, my lord.
DON PEDRO
Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part
almost a fray.
CLAUDIO
