Into the quiet closure of my breast,
And then my little heart were quite undone,
In his bed-chamber to be barred of rest.
  No, lady, no, my heart longs not to groan
  But soundly sleeps while now it sleeps alone.

"What have you urged that I cannot reprove?
The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger.
I hate not love, but your device in love,
That lends embracements unto every stranger.
  You do it for increase. O strange excuse,
  When reason is the bawd to lust's abuse!

"Call it not love, for Love to heaven is fled
Since sweating Lust on Earth usurped his name,
Under whose simple semblance he hath fed
Upon fresh beauty, blotting it with blame,
  Which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves,
  As caterpillars do the tender leaves.

"Love comforteth like sunshine after rain,
But Lust's effect is tempest after sun.
Love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain;
Lust's winter comes ere summer half be done.
  Love surfeits not, Lust like a glutton dies.
  Love is all truth, Lust full of forged lies.

"More I could tell, but more I dare not say;
The text is old, the orator too green.
Therefore in sadness now I will away.
My face is full of shame, my heart of teen.
  Mine ears, that to your wanton talk attended,
  Do burn themselves for having so offended."

With this he breaketh from the sweet embrace
Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast
And homeward through the dark laund runs apace,
Leaves Love upon her back deeply distressed.
  Look how a bright star shooteth from the sky,
  So glides he in the night from Venus' eye,

Which after him she darts, as one on shore
Gazing upon a late-embarked friend
Till the wild waves will have him seen no more,
Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend;
  So did the merciless and pitchy night
  Fold in the object that did feed her sight;

Whereat amazed, as one that unaware
Hath dropped a precious jewel in the flood,
