  Spurns at his love, and scorns the heat he feels,
  Beating his kind embracements with her heels.

Then like a melancholy malcontent,
He vails his tail that like a falling plume
Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent.
He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume.
  His love, perceiving how he was enraged,
  Grew kinder, and his fury was assuaged.

His testy master goeth about to take him
When, lo, the unbacked breeder, full of fear,
Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,
With her the horse, and left Adonis there.
  As they were mad unto the wood they hie them,
  Outstripping crows that strive to overfly them.

All swollen with chafing, down Adonis sits,
Banning his boisterous and unruly beast;
And now the happy season once more fits
That lovesick Love by pleading may be blessed;
  For lovers say the heart hath treble wrong
  When it is barred the aidance of the tongue.

An oven that is stopped, or river stayed,
Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage;
So of concealed sorrow may be said,
Free vent of words love's fire doth assuage,
  But when the heart's attorney once is mute,
  The client breaks, as desperate in his suit.

He sees her coming and begins to glow,
Even as a dying coal revives with wind,
And with his bonnet hides his angry brow,
Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind,
  Taking no notice that she is so nigh,
  For all askance he holds her in his eye.

O, what a sight it was wistly to view
How she came stealing to the wayward boy,
To note the fighting conflict of her hue,
How white and red each other did destroy!
  But now her cheek was pale, and by and by
  It flashed forth fire as lightning from the sky.

Now was she just before him as he sat,
And like a lowly lover down she kneels.
With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat;
Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels.
  His tend'rer cheek receives her soft hand's print
