  As air and water do abate the fire.

"This sour informer, this bate-breeding spy,
This canker that eats up Love's tender spring,
This carry-tale, dissentious Jealousy,
That sometimes true news, sometimes false doth bring,
  Knocks at my heart and whispers in mine ear
  That if I love thee, I thy death should fear;

"And more than so, presenteth to mine eye
The picture of an angry chafing boar,
Under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie
An image like thyself, all stained with gore,
  Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed
  Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head.

"What should I do, seeing thee so indeed,
That tremble at th' imagination?
The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed,
And fear doth teach it divination.
  I prophesy thy death, my living sorrow,
  If thou encounter with the boar tomorrow.

"But if thou needs wilt hunt, be ruled by me.
Uncouple at the timorous flying hare,
Or at the fox, which lives by subtlety,
Or at the roe, which no encounter dare.
  Pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs,
  And on thy well-breathed horse keep with thy hounds,

"And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare,
Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles
How he outruns the wind and with what care
He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles.
  The many musets through the which he goes
  Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.

"Sometimes he runs among a flock of sheep
To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,
And sometimes where earth-delving conies keep
To stop the loud pursuers in their yell,
  And sometimes sorteth with a herd of deer.
  Danger deviseth shifts; wit waits on fear.

"For there his smell with others being mingled,
The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,
Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled
With much ado the cold fault cleanly out.
  Then do they spend their mouths; echo replies
  As if another chase were in the skies.
