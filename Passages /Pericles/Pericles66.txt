DIANA
My temple stands in Ephesus: hie thee thither,
And do upon mine altar sacrifice.
There, when my maiden priests are met together,
Before the people all,
Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:
To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter's, call
And give them repetition to the life.
Or perform my bidding, or thou livest in woe;
Do it, and happy; by my silver bow!
Awake, and tell thy dream.

PERICLES
Celestial Dian, goddess argentine,
I will obey thee. Helicanus!
Re-enter HELICANUS, LYSIMACHUS, and MARINA

HELICANUS
Sir?
PERICLES
My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike
The inhospitable Cleon; but I am
For other service first: toward Ephesus
Turn our blown sails; eftsoons I'll tell thee why.
To LYSIMACHUS

Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore,
And give you gold for such provision
As our intents will need?
LYSIMACHUS
Sir,
With all my heart; and, when you come ashore,
I have another suit.
PERICLES
You shall prevail,
Were it to woo my daughter; for it seems
You have been noble towards her.
LYSIMACHUS
Sir, lend me your arm.
PERICLES
Come, my Marina.
Exeunt

SCENE II:
Enter GOWER, before the temple of DIANA at Ephesus

GOWER
Now our sands are almost run;
More a little, and then dumb.
