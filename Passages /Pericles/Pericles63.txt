Patience, good sir,
Or here I'll cease.
PERICLES
Nay, I'll be patient.
Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me,
To call thyself Marina.
MARINA
The name
Was given me by one that had some power,
My father, and a king.
PERICLES
How! a king's daughter?
And call'd Marina?
MARINA
You said you would believe me;
But, not to be a troubler of your peace,
I will end here.
PERICLES
But are you flesh and blood?
Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy?
Motion! Well; speak on. Where were you born?
And wherefore call'd Marina?
MARINA
Call'd Marina
For I was born at sea.
PERICLES
At sea! what mother?
MARINA
My mother was the daughter of a king;
Who died the minute I was born,
As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft
Deliver'd weeping.
PERICLES
O, stop there a little!
Aside

This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep
Did mock sad fools withal: this cannot be:
My daughter's buried. Well: where were you bred?
I'll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,
And never interrupt you.
MARINA
You scorn: believe me, 'twere best I did give o'er.
PERICLES
I will believe you by the syllable
Of what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave:
How came you in these parts? where were you bred?
MARINA
The king my father did in Tarsus leave me;
Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,
