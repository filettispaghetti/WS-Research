Boult, take you the marks of her, the colour of her
hair, complexion, height, age, with warrant of her
virginity; and cry 'He that will give most shall
have her first.' Such a maidenhead were no cheap
thing, if men were as they have been. Get this done
as I command you.
BOULT
Performance shall follow.

Alack that Leonine was so slack, so slow!
He should have struck, not spoke; or that these pirates,
Not enough barbarous, had not o'erboard thrown me
For to seek my mother!
Bawd
Why lament you, pretty one?
MARINA
That I am pretty.
Bawd
Come, the gods have done their part in you.
MARINA
I accuse them not.
Bawd
You are light into my hands, where you are like to live.
MARINA
The more my fault
To scape his hands where I was like to die.
Bawd
Ay, and you shall live in pleasure.
MARINA
No.
Bawd
Yes, indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of all
fashions: you shall fare well; you shall have the
difference of all complexions. What! do you stop your ears?
MARINA
Are you a woman?
Bawd
What would you have me be, an I be not a woman?
MARINA
An honest woman, or not a woman.
Bawd
Marry, whip thee, gosling: I think I shall have
something to do with you. Come, you're a young
foolish sapling, and must be bowed as I would have
you.
MARINA
