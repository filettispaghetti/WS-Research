Third Pirate
Half-part, mates, half-part.
Come, let's have her aboard suddenly.
Exeunt Pirates with MARINA

Re-enter LEONINE

LEONINE
These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes;
And they have seized Marina. Let her go:
There's no hope she will return. I'll swear
she's dead,
And thrown into the sea. But I'll see further:
Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,
Not carry her aboard. If she remain,
Whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain.

SCENE II. Mytilene. A room in a brothel.

Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULT
Pandar
Boult!
BOULT
Sir?
Pandar
Search the market narrowly; Mytilene is full of
gallants. We lost too much money this mart by being
too wenchless.
Bawd
We were never so much out of creatures. We have but
poor three, and they can do no more than they can
do; and they with continual action are even as good as rotten.
Pandar
Therefore let's have fresh ones, whate'er we pay for
them. If there be not a conscience to be used in
every trade, we shall never prosper.
Bawd
Thou sayest true: 'tis not our bringing up of poor
bastards,--as, I think, I have brought up some eleven--
BOULT
Ay, to eleven; and brought them down again. But
shall I search the market?
Bawd
What else, man? The stuff we have, a strong wind
will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden.
Pandar
Thou sayest true; they're too unwholesome, o'
conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead, that
lay with the little baggage.
