Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast
Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived
God Neptune's annual feast to keep: from whence
Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,
His banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense;
And to him in his barge with fervor hies.
In your supposing once more put your sight
Of heavy Pericles; think this his bark:
Where what is done in action, more, if might,
Shall be discover'd; please you, sit and hark.

SCENE I. On board PERICLES' ship, off Mytilene. A close

pavilion on deck, with a curtain before it; PERICLES
within it, reclined on a couch. A barge lying
beside the Tyrian vessel.
Enter two Sailors, one belonging to the Tyrian vessel, the other to the barge; to them HELICANUS

Tyrian Sailor
[To the Sailor of Mytilene] Where is lord Helicanus?
he can resolve you.
O, here he is.
Sir, there's a barge put off from Mytilene,
And in it is Lysimachus the governor,
Who craves to come aboard. What is your will?
HELICANUS
That he have his. Call up some gentlemen.
Tyrian Sailor
Ho, gentlemen! my lord calls.
Enter two or three Gentlemen

First Gentleman
Doth your lordship call?
HELICANUS
Gentlemen, there's some of worth would come aboard;
I pray ye, greet them fairly.
The Gentlemen and the two Sailors descend, and go on board the barge

Enter, from thence, LYSIMACHUS and Lords; with the Gentlemen and the two Sailors

Tyrian Sailor
Sir,
This is the man that can, in aught you would,
Resolve you.
LYSIMACHUS
Hail, reverend sir! the gods preserve you!
HELICANUS
And you, sir, to outlive the age I am,
And die as I would do.
