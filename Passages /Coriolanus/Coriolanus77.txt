CORIOLANUS
Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
mistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy
trencher, hence!
Beats him away. Exit third Servingman

Enter AUFIDIUS with the second Servingman

AUFIDIUS
Where is this fellow?
Second Servingman
Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for
disturbing the lords within.
Retires

AUFIDIUS
Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?
Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?
CORIOLANUS
If, Tullus,
Unmuffling

Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not
Think me for the man I am, necessity
Commands me name myself.
AUFIDIUS
What is thy name?
CORIOLANUS
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
And harsh in sound to thine.
AUFIDIUS
Say, what's thy name?
Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face
Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.
Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?
CORIOLANUS
Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st
thou me yet?
AUFIDIUS
I know thee not: thy name?
CORIOLANUS
My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
The extreme dangers and the drops of blood
Shed for my thankless country are requited
But with that surname; a good memory,
And witness of the malice and displeasure
Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;
