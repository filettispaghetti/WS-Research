First Servingman
Wine, wine, wine! What service
is here! I think our fellows are asleep.
Exit

Enter a second Servingman

Second Servingman
Where's Cotus? my master calls
for him. Cotus!
Exit

Enter CORIOLANUS

CORIOLANUS
A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I
Appear not like a guest.
Re-enter the first Servingman

First Servingman
What would you have, friend? whence are you?
Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door.
Exit

CORIOLANUS
I have deserved no better entertainment,
In being Coriolanus.
Re-enter second Servingman

Second Servingman
Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his
head; that he gives entrance to such companions?
Pray, get you out.
CORIOLANUS
Away!
Second Servingman
Away! get you away.
CORIOLANUS
Now thou'rt troublesome.
Second Servingman
Are you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon.
Enter a third Servingman. The first meets him

Third Servingman
What fellow's this?
First Servingman
