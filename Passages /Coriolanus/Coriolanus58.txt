Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,
A brand to the end o' the world.
SICINIUS
This is clean kam.
BRUTUS
Merely awry: when he did love his country,

Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
Spread further.
MENENIUS
One word more, one word.

And sack great Rome with Romans.

Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd

In peace, to his utmost peril.

BRUTUS
Go not home.
SICINIUS
Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:
