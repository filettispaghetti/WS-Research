The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap
as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.
All
In, in, in, in!
Exeunt

SCENE VI. Rome. A public place.

Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
SICINIUS
We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;
His remedies are tame i' the present peace
And quietness of the people, which before
Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,
Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold
Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
About their functions friendly.
BRUTUS
We stood to't in good time.
Enter MENENIUS

Is this Menenius?
SICINIUS
'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.
Both Tribunes
Hail sir!
MENENIUS
Hail to you both!
SICINIUS
Your Coriolanus
Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:
The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,
Were he more angry at it.
MENENIUS
All's well; and might have been much better, if
He could have temporized.
SICINIUS
Where is he, hear you?
MENENIUS
Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife
Hear nothing from him.
Enter three or four Citizens

Citizens
The gods preserve you both!
SICINIUS
God-den, our neighbours.
BRUTUS
