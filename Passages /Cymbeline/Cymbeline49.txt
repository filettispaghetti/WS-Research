The elected deer before thee?
PISANIO
But to win time
To lose so bad employment; in the which
I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,
Hear me with patience.
IMOGEN
Talk thy tongue weary; speak
I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear
Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,
Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.
PISANIO
Then, madam,
I thought you would not back again.
IMOGEN
Most like;
Bringing me here to kill me.
PISANIO
Not so, neither:

I'll give but notice you are dead and send him
Some bloody sign of it; for 'tis commanded

And that will well confirm it.

Or in my life what comfort, when I am
Dead to my husband?

With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,
That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me
As fearful as a siege.
PISANIO
If not at court,
Then not in Britain must you bide.
IMOGEN
Where then
Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,
