Where is she, sir? How
Can her contempt be answer'd?
Attendant
Please you, sir,
Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answer
That will be given to the loudest noise we make.
QUEEN
My lord, when last I went to visit her,
She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,
Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,
She should that duty leave unpaid to you,
Which daily she was bound to proffer: this
She wish'd me to make known; but our great court
Made me to blame in memory.
CYMBELINE
Her doors lock'd?
Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear
Prove false!
Exit

QUEEN
Son, I say, follow the king.
CLOTEN
That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,
have not seen these two days.
QUEEN
Go, look after.
Exit CLOTEN

Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!
He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence
Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes
It is a thing most precious. But for her,
Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized her,
Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown
To her desired Posthumus: gone she is
To death or to dishonour; and my end
Can make good use of either: she being down,
I have the placing of the British crown.
Re-enter CLOTEN

How now, my son!
CLOTEN
'Tis certain she is fled.
Go in and cheer the king: he rages; none
Dare come about him.
QUEEN
[Aside] All the better: may
This night forestall him of the coming day!
Exit
