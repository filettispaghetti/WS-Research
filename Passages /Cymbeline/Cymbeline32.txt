To be but named of thee. His meanest garment,
That ever hath but clipp'd his body, is dearer
In my respect than all the hairs above thee,
Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!
Enter PISANIO

CLOTEN
'His garment!' Now the devil--
IMOGEN
To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently--
CLOTEN
'His garment!'
IMOGEN
I am sprited with a fool.
Frighted, and anger'd worse: go bid my woman
Search for a jewel that too casually
Hath left mine arm: it was thy master's: 'shrew me,
If I would lose it for a revenue
Of any king's in Europe. I do think
I saw't this morning: confident I am
Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it:
I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
That I kiss aught but he.
PISANIO
'Twill not be lost.
IMOGEN
I hope so: go and search.
Exit PISANIO

CLOTEN
You have abused me:
'His meanest garment!'
IMOGEN
Ay, I said so, sir:
If you will make't an action, call witness to't.
CLOTEN
I will inform your father.
IMOGEN
Your mother too:
She's my good lady, and will conceive, I hope,
But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir,
To the worst of discontent.
Exit

CLOTEN
I'll be revenged:
'His meanest garment!' Well.
Exit
