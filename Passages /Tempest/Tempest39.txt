For yet ere supper-time must I perform
Much business appertaining.
Exit

SCENE II. Another part of the island.

Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO
STEPHANO
Tell not me; when the butt is out, we will drink
water; not a drop before: therefore bear up, and
board 'em. Servant-monster, drink to me.
TRINCULO
Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They
say there's but five upon this isle: we are three
of them; if th' other two be brained like us, the
state totters.
STEPHANO
Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes
are almost set in thy head.
TRINCULO
Where should they be set else? he were a brave
monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.
STEPHANO
My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:
for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I
could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues off
and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant,
monster, or my standard.
TRINCULO
Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.
STEPHANO
We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.
TRINCULO
Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet say
nothing neither.
STEPHANO
Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a
good moon-calf.
CALIBAN
How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
I'll not serve him; he's not valiant.
TRINCULO
Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to
justle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish thou,
was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much
sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie,
being but half a fish and half a monster?
CALIBAN
Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?
TRINCULO
