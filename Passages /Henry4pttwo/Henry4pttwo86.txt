SCENE V. A public place near Westminster Abbey.

Enter two Grooms, strewing rushes
First Groom
More rushes, more rushes.
Second Groom
The trumpets have sounded twice.
First Groom
'Twill be two o'clock ere they come from the
coronation: dispatch, dispatch.
Exeunt

Enter FALSTAFF, SHALLOW, PISTOL, BARDOLPH, and Page

FALSTAFF
Stand here by me, Master Robert Shallow; I will
make the king do you grace: I will leer upon him as
a' comes by; and do but mark the countenance that he
will give me.
PISTOL
God bless thy lungs, good knight.
FALSTAFF
Come here, Pistol; stand behind me. O, if I had had
time to have made new liveries, I would have
bestowed the thousand pound I borrowed of you. But
'tis no matter; this poor show doth better: this
doth infer the zeal I had to see him.
SHALLOW
It doth so.
FALSTAFF
It shows my earnestness of affection,--
SHALLOW
It doth so.
FALSTAFF
My devotion,--
SHALLOW
