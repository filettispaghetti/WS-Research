And so am I for no woman.
PHEBE
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
SILVIUS
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
ORLANDO
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
ROSALIND
Who do you speak to, 'Why blame you me to love you?'
ORLANDO
To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
ROSALIND
Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling
of Irish wolves against the moon.
To SILVIUS

I will help you, if I can:
To PHEBE

I would love you, if I could. To-morrow meet me all together.
To PHEBE

I will marry you, if ever I marry woman, and I'll be
married to-morrow:
To ORLANDO

I will satisfy you, if ever I satisfied man, and you
shall be married to-morrow:
To SILVIUS

I will content you, if what pleases you contents
you, and you shall be married to-morrow.
To ORLANDO

As you love Rosalind, meet:
To SILVIUS

as you love Phebe, meet: and as I love no woman,
I'll meet. So fare you well: I have left you commands.
SILVIUS
I'll not fail, if I live.
PHEBE
Nor I.
ORLANDO
Nor I.
Exeunt
