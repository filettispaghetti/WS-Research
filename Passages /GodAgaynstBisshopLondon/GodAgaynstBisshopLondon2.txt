Of the auctoryte of the word of god.

ABowt .v. yere agone I wrote to the noble king of scottys the father of my contry complay∣ning of a certen proclamacyon wherin the bisshops had forbidden the holy scripture to be redd in the mother tong. I answered also to certen slaunderos lyes of cochleus / whom the bisshops had hyred to spewe out all the poison in his bely against me. For I was at antwerp whan a contry man of myne whose name was Iohn fo∣ster did send a sōme of mony vnto Cochle∣us by a marchant from the bisshop of. S. Andrews which geueth him yerely so long as he liueth a certen stipend. And it chāced by the goodnes of god / wherby he disclo∣seth the wickednes of these hipocytes / that a pistle of Cochleus which he sent vnto a certen bisshop of pole / came vnto my han∣des / wherin he complayneth that he hath gret losse and euel fortune in setting forth of bokes for as moch as no man wil wete∣saue to rede his bokes. And he beggeth a y•¦rely
Page  [unnumbered]
stipend of the bisshops of pole saing that he hath bene nobly rewarded of the king of scottys and of the archbisshop of. s. Andrews and of the bisshop of glasguo. And were it not for the loue of my contry and of the kinges grace I wold cause his pistle to be printed with the copy of the kin∣gs letters which he send vnto a certen biss∣hop of pole / & because he shal knowe that I haue a copy of the kings letters the king doth write manifestly that Cochleus boke dyd more please him for the cōmendacyon of Kyng Ferdinandus and of Erasmus than for any study or diligēce of the autor. I wil not vtter other things contayned in the sayd letters neyther wold I haue disclo¦sed thus moch but that I wold wissh that the king were admonisshed to cōsidre whe¦ther cochleus were a man worthy to be pre∣sented with his letters and his princely re∣ward or no. And because I wold auoyde the furios enuy of this blasphemos impu∣dent rayler whō the bisshops had hyred to
Page  [unnumbered]
bark agaynst me (for beside slanderos ray∣lyng wordes he made me no answer at all / and he threatned me that he wold send me home agayne if he could bring it to passe / vnto the bisshops with my handes bownd behynd me) for the which cause / I say / I did cast in my mynd to chang agayne that cōtry where I was specially seing I was called in to Ingland by the right noble lord Crumwel and the Archbisshop of cā∣terbery. for the railyng wretch Cochleus did manifestly wright that he was sorer greued with me for dwelling in that place where I did remayne / than he was with my matter or with any other thing els. I considered that christ gaue place somtymes vnto the furiosnes of the Iewes & agay∣ne that curr dogges which be tyed at mens gates to bark / whā no man is by them thā thei slepe and make no besynes at all. And therfor I thought to auoyde his rayling writings by no meanes so well / as if I sh∣uld goo in to Ingland and euen stopp my∣ne
Page  [unnumbered]
eares at his rauyng. And in dede I was not deceiued / for the serpēt left his hissing / and I was louingly receyued not only of the Archbisshop / and of the honorable lord Crumwel / but euen of the right noble king himselfe also / and I was sent vnto Cam¦bridge to reade a lecture of the scripture the¦re / but the crosse foloweth alweys christes doctrine / wher soeuer it goeth / & the deuel hath euer enuye that christ shuld haue any rest / for euen in the wildernes he wold not suffer him to be quiet a lone / vntil he had brought him vnto the crosse. I had scasely declared out the .viij. psalme / but I percey¦ued myne enemy going a bout to wrap me in contencions. the which although I hate naturally and haue studied always to my powr to auoyde them / yet I neuer submit∣ted my self cowardly to the deuel nor neuer recanted any thing sins I had any knoule¦ge of christes true gospel. And whan I wold haue made answer there for such do∣ctrine as I had tawght / I came to the scho¦les
Page  [unnumbered]
of the vniuersite where a gret nomber of auditors was gathered / and there before the whole multitude I taryed an howr or ij loking whan myne aduersary shuld come. but he although he refrayned from dispu∣tacyon (for what purpose or consideracyon I can not tel) yet he cōspired me such enuy that there were some that were not a frayd to threaten me that it shuld cost me my life which thing after I had opened to the vy∣chanceler by the councel of certen of the wi¦sest men there / and sawe him winke at the matter / I gaue place to this malyce also and departed from thens / specially for as moch as I perceyued there were statutes sent forth from the bisshops and from the whole councel of the reame which were su∣ch that it had bene wickednes not to haue spoken openly against them and yet to ha∣ue reproued them it shuld haue bene coun∣ted a poynt of sedicyon. The man was not hyndered nor put in feare by me / but the chanceler of the vniuersyte which sent me
Page  [unnumbered]
thether by the commandment of the king wold suffer none of his vniuersyte to speak against any of the comon lawes. wherfor I determined with my self to serue the ty∣me and to change the preaching of the cro∣sse with the scyence of physik wherin I had a litle sight before / And thus I went vnto a very well lerned phisyciā called doc∣tor Nicolas which hath practised phisyk in lōdō thes many yeares with high pray∣se / whose company I dyd vse certen yea∣res wherby I did both see and lern many things euen the principal poyntes concer∣ning that science. In so moch that at len∣gth certen of my frindes did moue me to take in hand to practise / which thing I did I trust not vnluckyly. But yet not with∣stonding this / cōtrary to all my expectaci¦on I chanced to fall agayn in to such a di∣sputacyon as I was in before / and in ma∣ner with like aduersarys / for before I was vexyd with my contry bisshops and with an hyred railer Cochleus about the rea∣ding
Page  [unnumbered]
of the scripture in the mother tong. And it fortuned me to haue a like conten∣cion with certen bisshops of Ingland (whi¦ch maynteyne still the bisshop of rome so farre as thei dare) whether all things neces¦sary vnto our saluacyon be conteyned in the scripture / or but a part only and the re∣sydue to be taken out of the gloses of the do∣ctors / out of the actes of old councels and out of popes lousy decreys. And vnto this disputaciō I came sodenly vnprepared / for as I did mete bi chance in the streate the right excellent lord Crumwel going vnto the parlament howse in the yeare .1537. he whan he sawe me / called me vnto him / & toke me with him to the parlamēt hou∣se to westmyster where we fownd all the bisshops gathered to gether. vnto whom as he went and toke me with him / all the biss∣hops and prelates did rise vp and did obei∣sance vnto him as to their vicar general and after he had saluted them he sate him down in the highest place & right against
Page  [unnumbered]
hym sate the Archibisshop of cantorbery / after him the Archbisshop of yorke / and than London / Lincoln / Salisbery / Bathe Ely / Herford / Chichester / Norwich / Ro∣chester and Worcester and certē other who¦se names I haue forgoten / all these did sit• at a table couered with a carpet with certē prystes standing about them.

Than the lord Crumwel being vicar general of the reame / lord of the preuy sea∣le and chefe secret counceler vnto the king turned him self to the bisshops & sayd. Ri∣ght reuerend fathers in christ / The kings maiesty geueth yow high thankes that ye haue so diligently without any excuse as∣sembled hether acording to his command∣ment / and ye be not ignorant that ye be cal¦led hether to determyne certen cōtrouersys which at this tyme be moued concernyng the christen religion and faith not only in this reame but also in all nacions thorowt the world: for the kīg studieth day & night to set a quietnes in the church / and he can
Page  [unnumbered]
not rest vntil all such controuersis be fully debated and ended thorow the determina∣cyon of yow and of his whole parlament. For all though his special desyre is to set a stey for the vnlerned peple whose conscien∣ces are in dout what thei may bileue / and he him selfe by his excellent lerning kno∣weth these controuersys welinough / yet he wil suffer no comon alteracyon / but by the consent of yow and of his whole parlamēt By the which thing ye may perceiue both his high wisdom / and also his gret loue to∣ward yow / & he desiereth yow for christes sake that all malyce obstynacy & carnal re¦spect set apart / ye will frindly & louingly dispute among your selues of the cōtrouer¦sys moued in the church and that ye wyl cōclude all things by the word of god with out all brauling / or scolding / neither will his magesty suffer the scripture to be wr•∣sted & defaced by any glosys / any papisti∣cal lawes or by any auctoryte of doctors or councels and moch lesse wil he admit any
Page  [unnumbered]
articles or doctrine not conteyned in the scripture but approued only by cōtynuan∣ce of tyme and old custome and by vnwrit¦ton verytes as ye were wont to doo. Ye know wel īough that ye be bound to shewe this seruice to christ & to his church & yet notwithstōding his magesty wil giue you high thanckes / if ye wil set & cōclude a god¦ly and a perfight vnyte / wherunto this is the only way and meane if ye wil determy¦ne all things by the scripture as god com∣mādeth yow in deuteronomy / which thing his maiesty exhorteth and desyreth yow.

Whan the lord crumwel had spoken his mynd after this sort with high grauyte (as he was a man of a gret witt / of excellent wisdom and of goodly eloquēce) all the bis∣shops did ryse vp and gaue thankes to the kings maiesty for his feruēt study and de∣syre toward an vnite and for this vertuos exhortacyon most worthy a christen king. After this began thei to dispute of the sa∣cramentes. And first of all the bisshop of
Page  [unnumbered]
london which was an ernest defender of the popes part / whom a litel before the lord crumwel had rebuked by name for defen∣ding of vnwritton verites / this bisshop of london / I say / went about to defend that there were .vij. sacramētes of our christē re¦ligion which he wold proue by certē stinck∣ing gloses and old lousy writers / and he had vp on his syde the Archbisshop of york the bisshop of lincoln / bath / chichyster and norwich / The bisshop of salisbery / Ely / her¦ford and worcester and certē other with the Archbisshop of Cantorbery / were against him. And after thei had made moch strife and cōtencyon about the saings of the doc¦tors one contrary to a nother / The bisshop of cantorbery spake and sayd thus. It bese∣meth not men of lerning & grauyte to ma¦ke moche babling and brauling about bare wordes so that we agree in the very substā∣ce and effect of the matter. For to braule a¦bowt wordes Is the property of sophisters and such as meane disceight and suttilty
Page  [unnumbered]
which delight in the debate and dissencyon of the world and in the miserable state of the church / and not of them which shuld se¦ke the glory of christ and shuld study for the vnyte and quietnes of the church. There be waighty controuersis now moued & put forth / not of ceremonis & light things but of the tru vnderstanding and of the right difference of the lawe and of the gospel / of the maner and way how synnes be forge∣uen / of cowmforting doutful and wauer∣ing consciēces by what meanes thei may be certifyed that thei please god seing thei fele the strength of the lawe accusing them of sinne / of the true vse of the sacramētes / whether the outward work of them doth iustifye man or whether we receyue our iustificacyon thorow fayth. Item which be the good workes and the true seruice and honor which pleaseth god / and whether the choise of meates / the difference of garmen¦tes / the vowys of monkes and pristes and other tradicyōs which haue no word of god
Page  [unnumbered]
to cōfirme them / whether these / I say / be∣right good workes and such as make a perf•¦ght christen man or no. Item whether vai¦ne seruyce and false honoryng of god and mans tradicyons do bynd mens conscien∣ces or no. Finally whether the ceremonis of confirmacyon / of orders and of annealing and soch other (which can not be proued to be institute of christ nor haue any word in them to certifye us of remissyon of sin∣nes) ought to be called sacramentes and to be cōpared with baptim and the supper of the lord or no. Thes be no light maters but euen the principal poyntes of our christen religiō / wherfor we contend not about wor¦des and trifles but of high and ernest mat¦ters. Christ saith. Blessed be the peace ma∣kers / for thei shal be called the sōnys of god And Paul cōmandeth bisshops to auoyde brawling and cōtencion about words whi∣ch be profitable to nothīg but vnto the sub¦uersion and destructiō of the hearers. and be monissheth specially that he shuld resist
Page  [unnumbered]
with the scriptures whan any man dispu∣teth with him of the fayth & he addeth a cause wher as he sayth. Doing this thou shalt preserue both thy selfe and also them which heare the. Now if ye wil folow th•∣se councellers Christ and Paul / all conten¦cyon and brauling about wordes must be set apart and ye must stablissh a godly and a perfight vnyte & cōcord out of the scrip∣ture. Wherfor in this disputaciō we must first agree of the nomber of the sacramen∣tes and what a sacrament doth signify in the holy scripture / and whan we cal bapty∣me and the supper of the lord sacramentes of the gospell / what we meane therby. I knowe right wel that. s. Ambrose and oth∣er autors calle the wasshīg of the disciples fete and other things / sacramētes / which I am sure yow your selues wold not suffer to be nombred among the other sacramen∣tes.

This exhortacyon did the archbisshop make most soberly & discretely as he is a
Page  [unnumbered]
man of a singular grauyte / with such swe¦tenes that it did my hart good to hear him And bicause I did signifye bi some token of my countnance that this admonicyō of the archbisshop did please & delight me ex∣cellētly wel / the lord cromwel bad me spea∣ke what I thought of this disputacyō / but he told the bisshops before that I was the kings scolar and therfor he desiered them to be cōtent to heare me indifferently. Than I after the rude maner of the scholes rather than after any courtly solemny∣te / bowing my knee for a token of curtesy and reuerence / as It became me / with out any preface at all / begā to speake after this maner. Ryght honorable & noble lord and yow most reuerend fathers and prelates of the church / although I come vnprepared vnto this disputacyon / yet trusting in the ayde of christ which promiseth to geue bo∣th mouth and wisdom vnto vs whan we be required of our fayth / I wil vtter my sē¦tence and iudgement of this disputacyon.
Page  [unnumbered]
And I think that my lord archbisshop ha∣th geuen you a profitable exhortacion that ye shuld first agree of the significacyon of a sacramēt. whether ye wil call a sacramēt a ceremony institute of christ in the gospel to signifie a special or a singular vertu of the gospel and of godlines (as paul namith remissyon of sinnes to be) or whether ye mene that euery ceremony generally whi∣ch may be a token or a significacyon of an holy thing / to be a sacramēt. For after this latter significacyon I wil not stike to gra∣nt yow that there be .vij. sacramentes and more to If ye wil. But yet Paul semeth to describe a sacrament after the first sig∣nificacion wheras he sayth that circūcisiō is a token and a seale of the rightwisnes of fayth: This diffinycion of one particu∣lar sacrament must be vnderstōd to pertei∣ne vnto all sacramentes generally / for the Iewes had but one sacrament only as all the scholastical writers do grant. And he describeth baptyme after the same maner
Page  [unnumbered]
in the .v. to the Ephesians wheras he sayth that Christ doth sanctifye the church) that is to say all that be baptised) thorow the bath of water in the word of life. For here also he addeth the word and promes of god vnto the ceremony / and Christ also requi∣reth fayth where as he saith / who so euer bileueth and is baptised / shal be saued. And s. Austen describeth a sacramēt thus / The word of god coming vnto the element / ma∣keth the sacrament / and in a nother place he saith a sacrament is a thing wherin the pour of god vnder the forme of visible thin¦ges doth work secretly saluacyon. And the master of the sentences doth describe a sa∣crament no nother wise. A sacramēt saith he is an inuysible grace and hath a visible forme / and bi this inuysible grace I mea∣ne / saith he / remissyon of sinnes. Finally s. Thomas denieth that any mā hath auc∣torite to institute a sacrament. Now if ye agree vnto this diffinicyon of a sacramēt / it is an easy thing to iudge of the nomber
