And this refuge or excuse to say that although the scripture be profi∣table for such thīgs / yet it is not sufficyēt. That is false sayth paul / For I affirme / sayth he / that the holy scriptures do teach us abundantly all thyngs / wherby a man of god that is to say a christen man / may be perfight and apt or ready vnto all good∣nes. and thus it foloweth also / that thei te∣ach lyes which affirme any workes to be good / that are not conteyned in the scrip∣ture.

Now the other part of his reason he proueth thus. Those which folowe foliss• questyons / contencyons of wordes / stran∣ge old wyues fables / and to be short / the do∣ctrines of men not conteyned in the word of god / do swarue and erre from the faith

Specially if thou wilt monissh the christen brethern both of the holsom doctryn and also of the deuels erronios doctrine / as it becōmeth a faythful minister of Iesus christ. Preach & teach these things saith he / to all faith∣ful men / namely to such as may be apt to teach other likewys. And agayne / If thou puttest them in remēberāce of these thīgs / thou shalt be a faithful minister of Iesus christ / brought vp in the word of faith and of the true doctrine which thou hast folo¦wed vntil this day. But se that thou ba∣nisch & contemne all vnholy and old wy∣uissh fables / and rather exercyse thy selfe vnto vertu and godlines. Take deligent he¦de to thy self and to thy doctrine & stand fast in it / for so doīg thou shalt saue both

thiself and them that hear the. Afterward he geueth him a commandment and saith this precept do I charge the with O son ti¦mothy / acordinge to the prophecies that be past befor thy daies / that thou fight a good battel in thē / with a sure perfight faith & a good or right vp conseyence / which / certē not regarding haue suffred gret harme & losse in their fayth &c. And euen in these wordes he teacheth us to fight agaynst the deuel euen with the old prophecy or prophe∣tical scripture / and to confirme our faith by it and also to forme and rule our conscy¦ence by it. And he sheweth a cause / for els we shal lose our faith as other haue done / & we shal procure our selues a wauering and a dowtful consciēce. Finally he is not content and satisfied to haue geuen hym this monicyon / but he also entreateth & be¦sechith him by all meanes / saing I besech the for gods sake and for our lorde Iesus christes sake which shal iudge both quick and dead at his coming / and for his king∣doms sake / preach the word / be instant /

be ernest and importune in season and out of seasō / reproue / chide / & exhort with gen¦tilnes or sobrenes & with doctryne. For the time shal come whā mē shal not suffer the holsom doctrine / but thei shal procure thē selues masters acordīg to their own affecci¦ons and appetices &c. This tyme which he speaketh of heare / if it be not now / let us ne¦uer loke for it. For now our faith is confir¦med with a vnwrittō word with mās tra¦dicyons / with custome / ceremonis / fathers and cowncels with out any word of god / and the manifest scripture is moked out with euery crafty hipocrites Imaginaci∣on and glose. yea it is takē out of our han∣des and burnt. Now if these men be not lo¦uers of them selues and estemers of their own wisdom / if thei be not couetos / if thei be not arrogant and vaine glorios / if thei be not braggers and blasphemers / which ymagin a new vnwrittō word / if thei be not dissobedient & vnthankful vnto their parentes which wil not ones moue their fo¦te

out of their deanes to helpe an old man or to comfort their parentes lying at the po¦int of death / if thei be not vnkind & vnna¦tural which for their fayned chastite dare not knowe their own childerne / if thei be not truse breakers that vnmercifully war∣re against vertu and godlines / if thei be not deuels & quarelers and the very mem¦bers of the deuel / which do nothīg but yma¦gine cauillacyōs to mocke a way the truth / if thei be not voluptuos / ryetors / merciles neglectors of their office / despisers of all ler¦ning and of all true good workes / if thei be not traiteros betrayers of kings / kingdōs / & of the whole world / if thei be not louers of wordly pleasures and lustes rather than louers of god / which condēne matrimony lest thei shuld be compelled to mary wiues / but might still liue in whordome with o¦ther mennes wiues / if thei denie not the vertu / pyth and effect of godlines / & that vnder a color and pretence of true holynes which esteme mans tradiciōs higher than

the .x. commandmentes of god / and teach that their own tradicyons and ceremonys be sufficiēt to make a perfight christē man that thei may minissh & drowne the iusty¦ficaciō of faith / ther were neuer none such nor neuer shalbe.

Paul whan he shuld take his last vale of the church or congregaciō and byd them farewel for euer / he called a cowncel whose auctoryte and testimony he wold haue to be estemed and regarded of all men / and in that councel he preached thus vnto the bis∣hops. I take you all to witnes / and testifye vnto you all this day that y am innocēt pu¦re & clere frō the blode of you all / for I ha¦ue kept secret frō you none of those things which concerne your profyght and salua∣cyon / but I haue opened vnto you all the councel of god for the space of .iij. yeares / day & night without ceasing and I mo∣nisshed & exhorted euery one of you euen with weping teares. For I know right wel that after my departing there shal co∣me

among yow rauening wolues which shal haue no pyty or compassyon vp on the flock / and certen among you shal teach fal¦se and wicked doctryne to allure discyples after them / Wherfore take diligent hede both vnto your self and to all your floke / and watch / remembryng that I haue mo∣nysshed you of these things / for the space of .iij. yere together with gret lamentacyō. And now brethern / I commit you vn∣to the word of his grace which is able to edi¦fye you and to gyue you an inherytance with all them that be sanctifyed. &c.

Here doth paul monissh the councel of the false and lying prophetes and he exhor¦teth the whole church that thei remember diligētly his monicyon wher of he had put them in rememberāce continually for the space of .iij. yeares that thei shuld take hede of those wolues which had deuoured both bodis and soules of men with wicked doctri¦ne / opinions & tradicions which thei wold thrust in to the church vnder this color and

cloke / that the apostles could not teach all things necessary vnto our faith and salua¦cyon / and that all the articles of the chris∣ten faith are not conteyned in the word of the grace of god. I haue taken yow to re∣cord this day / sayth he / For this cause that if ye cast a way & damne your selues tho∣row bileuing theyr persuasions / I am pu¦re & clere from your bloude / & christ shal not reken vnto me your damnacyon. For I know that this thing wil come to passe and I tremble and shake / euery ioynt of me / for the miserable perturbacyons and aduersites of the church whā the propheci∣es which speake of the latter dayes / come to my remembrance. And I feared lest christ shuld reken it vnto me vnd lay it vn∣to my charge / if I shuld not haue moni∣shed you before.

And this thing with the horrible blas¦phemys and Idolatry which shal opresse the church / hath made me so heauy & ca∣reful / and hath caused me to water myne

eyes so oft. But what shal I doo whan I heare danyel sayng. The determinacion is concluded: I can no notherwise do than monissh you that ye heare or receyue no ne¦we opynions vnder any such cloke or color as though I had not opened vnto you all the councel of god somoch as perteyneth vn to you to know / or as though I had hidden any thing from you which shuld be neces∣sary vnto your saluacion. I can not tell what to say more / but only to commit and referre you vnto the word of the grace of god / that is to say / to the holy scriptures which all are able to edifye and to bilde you vpon the tru foundacion which is christ / wherupon the whole church / all the patri∣arckes / prophetes and apostles be bylded and grounded / Christ is the foundacion of the church we be the stones and stikes whi∣ch are proued and assayed with diuers ten∣taciōs and aflictions / The holy gost is the master bylder or worck man / and the word of god is the clay & lyme which holdeth

the whole bildīg to gether. For by the word of god we are incorporate vnto the church / and by it we abide and remayn in the chur¦che. This word also incorporateth ioyneth / & groundeth us perfightly to christ / that we shuld not be drawn away and ledde a∣bout with euery blasing wynd of doctryne and so fall a way agayne. This is a good bucler agaynst all the fiery dartes of the de¦uel. This is the sterne wherby alone / the shyp of the church is ruled. This is the an∣ker which ones brokē or lost / our faith must nedes vtterly perissh. To this word peter biddeth us loke as vnto a lantern which in the dark night of ignorance / of the cōtem∣pt of god of infidelite and of all weakenes of such hartes as be blinded of the deuel she¦weth the light of faith and the knouledge of gods will that we fall to no heresis nor receyue the doctrine of the false lying pro∣phetes. And by this light which chaseth a way all darknes of errors / Christ and Pe∣ter cōmand us to examen and trye all ma∣ner

of doctrine as by the true toche stone. And Paul biddeth us ronn vnto this in all stormes as vnto the most sure anckar / & to resist or withstand all maner of strā∣ge doctrines with the holy scripture / and Christ doth plainly pronounce that by this we shal be iudged at the last day. Iohn wri¦teth / this to be sufficient to obteyne euer lasting life by. And christ sendeth the man which enquired of him by what meanes he might be saued / vnto this scripture / which luke saith that he hath writton with all dy¦ligence. Esay sent them which sought ne∣we reuelacions vnto this word / Christ also sent them which required myracles vnto this: saing Thei haue Moyses and the pro¦phetes if thei wil not byleue them / neither wold thei bylefe if any shuld ryse from dea¦th. By this word doth Moyses command kings to feare god / and he biddeth the prist∣es to iudge by this word / and at last he say∣th / let this word be writō out to you before your eies / that no man may be excused of
Page  [unnumbered]
ignorance / and he saith further / that heauē & erth shal witnes against us at the latter day / that we geue ouer our selues agayne frely / willingly and wetingly vnto the de∣uel / if we receyue any doctryne not appro∣ued by the word of god / or if we iudge & de∣termyne any thing of the wil & plesure of god without some testymony of the holy scripture. Now these testimonys ga¦thered out of the holy scripture be sufficient against this grosse blasphemy of the vnwritton word.
