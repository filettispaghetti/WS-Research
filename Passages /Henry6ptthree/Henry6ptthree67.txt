MONTAGUE
Then fare you well, for I will hence again:
I came to serve a king and not a duke.
Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.
The drum begins to march

KING EDWARD IV
Nay, stay, Sir John, awhi le, and we'll debate
By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.
MONTAGUE
What talk you of debating? in few words,
If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king,
I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone
To keep them back that come to succor you:
Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?
GLOUCESTER
Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?
KING EDWARD IV
When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:
Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.
HASTINGS
Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.
GLOUCESTER
And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand:
The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.
KING EDWARD IV
Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,
And Henry but usurps the diadem.
MONTAGUE
Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;
And now will I be Edward's champion.
HASTINGS
Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd:
Come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation.
Flourish

Soldier
Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king of
England and France, and lord of Ireland, & c.
MONTAGUE
And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right,
By this I challenge him to single fight.
Throws down his gauntlet

All
Long live Edward the Fourth!
KING EDWARD IV
Thanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all:
If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness.
