The red rose and the white are on his face,
The fatal colours of our striving houses:
The one his purple blood right well resembles;
The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth:
Wither one rose, and let the other flourish;
If you contend, a thousand lives must wither.
Son
How will my mother for a father's death
Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied!
Father
How will my wife for slaughter of my son
Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!
KING HENRY VI
How will the country for these woful chances
Misthink the king and not be satisfied!
Son
Was ever son so rued a father's death?
Father
Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?
KING HENRY VI
Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?
Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.
Son
I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.
Exit with the body

Father
These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;
My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre,
For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go;
My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell;
And so obsequious will thy father be,
Even for the loss of thee, having no more,
As Priam was for all his valiant sons.
I'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will,
For I have murdered where I should not kill.
Exit with the body

KING HENRY VI
Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,
Here sits a king more woful than you are.
Alarums: excursions. Enter QUEEN MARGARET, PRINCE EDWARD, and EXETER

PRINCE EDWARD
Fly, father, fly! for all your friends are fled,
And Warwick rages like a chafed bull:
Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.
QUEEN MARGARET
Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain:
Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds
