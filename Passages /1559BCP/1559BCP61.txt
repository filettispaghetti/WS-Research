from henceforth blessed are the dead, which die in the
Lord. Euen so sayeth the Spirite, that they rest from
their labour#.

Â¶ Then all follow this Leon, taken out of the xv. Chapter to the Corinthians,
the fir Epile.
Hrist i# risen from the dead, and become the first
fruit# of them that sleepe. For by a man came
death, and by a man came the resurrection of the
dead. For a# by Adam all die, euen so by Christ
shal all bee made aliue, but euery man in hi#
owne order. The first i# Christ, then they that are Christ# at
hi# comming. Then commeth the end, when he hath deliuered
vp the kingdome to God the Father, when he hath put downe
all rule, and all authority and power. For hee must reigne till
he haue put hi# enemie# vnder hi# feete. The last enemy that
shall be destroyed i# death. For hee hath put all thing# vnder
hi# feete. But when hee saith, all thing# are put vnder him, it
1. Corin. 15,
20. 
i# manifest that he i# excepted that hath put all thing# vnder
hym. When all thing# are subdued vnto him, then shall the
Sonne also himselfe be subiecte vnto him that put all thing#
vnder him, that God may be all in all. Else what doe they
which are baptized ouer the dead, if the dead rise not at all?
Why are they then baptized ouer them? yea, and why stand we
alway then in ieopardy? By our reioycing which I haue in
Christ Jesu our Lord, I die dayly. That I haue fought with
beast# at Ephesu# after the manner of men, what aduantageth
it me, if the dead rise not againe? Let v# eate and drinke, for
to morrow wee shall die. Bee not yee deceiued; euill word#
corrupt good manner#. Awake truely out of sleepe, and sinne
not. For some haue not the knowledge of God. I speake thi#
to your shame. But some man will say How arise the dead?
With what body shall they come? Thou foole, that which thou
sowest i# not quickened except it die. And what sowest thou?
Thou sowest not that body that shall bee, but bare corne, a# of
wheat or some other : but God giueth it a body at hi# pleasure,
to euery seede hi# owne body. All flesh i# not one manner of
flesh : but there i# one manner of flesh of men, another manner
of flesh of beast#, another of fishe#, an other of bird#. There
are also celestiall bodie#, and there are bodie# terrestriall. But
the glory of the celestiall i# one, and the glory of the terrestriall
i# another. There i# one manner glory of the Sunne, and
another glory of the Moone, and another glory of the Starre#.
For one Starre differeth from another in glory. So i# the
resurrection of the dead. It i# sowen in corruption, it riseth
againe in incorruption. It i# sowen in dishonour, it riseth
againe in honour. It i# sowen in weaknesse, it riseth againe in
