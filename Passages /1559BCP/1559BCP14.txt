hold the Catholique Faith.
Which Faith, except euery one
doe keepe whole and vndefiled :
without doubt he shall perish euerlastingly.

And the Catholique Faith i#
thi# : that we worsip one God in
Trinitie, and Trinitie in Unitie.
Neither confounding the person#
: nor diuiding the substance.
Quicunque
Vult.
For there i# one person of the Father, another of the Son :
and another of the holy Ghost.
But the Godhead of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the
holy Ghost, i# all one : the glory equall, the Maiesty coeternall.
Such a# the Father i#, such i# the Sonne : and such i# the
holy Ghost.
The Father vncreate, the Sonne vncreate : and the holy
Ghost vncreate.
The Father incomprehensible, the Sonne incomprehensible :
and the holy Ghost incomprehensible.
The Father eternall, the Sonne eternall : and the holy
Ghost eternall.
And yet they are not three eternal# : but one eternall.
A# also there be not three incomprehensible#, nor three
vncreated : but one vncreated, and one incomprehensible.
So likewise the Father i# Almightie, the Sonne Almighty :
and the holy Ghoste Almighty.
And yet they are not three Almightie# : but one Almighty.
So the Father i# God, the Sonne i# God : and the holy
Ghost i# God.
And yet they are not three God# : but one God. 
So lykewise the Father i# Lord, the Sonne Lord : and the
holy Ghost Lord.
And yet not three Lord# : but one Lord.
For like a# we be compelled by the Christian veritie : to acknowledge
euery person by himselfe to be God and Lord.
So are we forbidden by the Catholique Religion : to say
there be three God#, or three Lord#.
The Father i# made of none : neither created, nor begotten.
The Sonne i# of the Father alone : not made, nor created,
but begotten.
The holy Ghost i# of the Father, and of the Sonne: neither
made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.
So there i# one Father, not three Father#, one Sonne, not
three Sonne# : one holy Ghost, not three holy Ghost#.
And in thi# Trinitie, none i# afore, or after other : none i#
greater or lesse then another.
But the whole three person# bee coeternall together : and
