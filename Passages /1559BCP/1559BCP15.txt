coequall.
So that in all thing#, a# i# aforesaid : the Unitie in Trinitie,
and the Trinitie in Unitie i# to be worshipped.
He therefore that will bee saued: must thu# thinke of the
Trinitie.
Furthermore it i# necessary to euerlasting saluation : that he
also beleeue rightly in the incarnation of our Lord Jesu Christ.
For the right Faith i#, that we beleeue & confesse : that our
Lord Jesu# Christe the Sonne of God, i# God and man.
God of the substaunce of the Father, begotten before the
world# : and man of the substauce of hi# mother, borne in the
world.
Perfect god, and perfect man : of a reasonable soule, and
humane flesh subsisting.
Equall to the father a# touching hi# Godhead : and inferior
to the Father, touching hi# manhood.
Who although he be God and man : yet he i# not two, but
one Christ.
One; not by conuersion of the Godhead into flesh : but by
taking of the manhood into God;
One altogether, not by confusion of substaunce : but by vnity
of person. 
For a# the reasonable soule and flesh i# but one man : so
God and man i# but one Christ.
Who suffered for our saluation : descended into hell, rose
againe the third day from the dead.
He ascended into heauen: he sitteth on the right hand of the
Father, God Almighty : from whence he shall come to iudge
the quicke and the dead.
At whose comming all men shall rise againe with their bodie#
: and shall geue account for their owne work#.
And they that haue done good, shall go into life euerlasting
: and they that haue done euill, into euerlastyng fire.
Thi# i# the Catholique faith : whiche except a man beleeue
faithfully, he cannot be saued.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne : and to the holy
Ghost.
A# it wa# in the beginning, i# now, and euer shall be :
world without end. Amen.
Thus endeth the order of Morning and Euening prayer
throughout the whole yeere. 
¶ Here followeth the Letanie, to
be vſed vpon Sundayes, Wedneſdayes, and Fridayes,
and at other times when it albe commanded

v# miserable sinner#.
O God the father of heauen : haue mercy vpon vs
miſerable ſynners.
