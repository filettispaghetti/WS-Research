The ſame order all the Curate vſe with thoſe, betwixt whome hee perceiueth
malice and hatred to raigne, not ſuffering them to he partakers of the
Lords Table vntill hee know them to be reconciled. And if one of the parties
so at variance, be content to forgiue from the bottome of his heart, all that
the other hath treſpaed again him, and to make amends for that he him-
ſelfe hath offended, and the other party will not be perſwaded to a godly
vnity, but remain ill in his frowardnee and malice: the Minister in that
caſe, ought to admit the penitent perſon to the holy Communion, and not
him that is obinate

Lmighty God, vnto whom all heart# be open, all desire#
knowne, and from whom no secret# are hid:
cleanse the thought# of our heart# by the inspiration of
thy holy Spirit, that we may perfectly loue thee, & worthily
magnifie thy holy Name, through Christ our Lord. Amen.
