continuall helpe, that in all our worke# begunne,
continued, and ended in thee, wee may glorify thy
holy Name, and finally by thy mercie, obtaine
euerlasting life, through Jesu# Christ our Lord. Amen. 
Lmighty God, the fountaine of all wisedom, which
knowest our necessitie# before we aske, and our
ignorance in asking, wee heseech thee to haue
compasssion vpon our infirmitie#, and those thing#
which for our vnworthinesse we dare not, and for our blindnesse
we cannot aske, vouchsafe to giue v# for the worthinesse
of thy Sonne Jesu# Christ our Lord. Amen.
Lmighty God, whiche hast promysed to heare the
petition# of them that aske in thy Sonne# Name,
wee beseech thee mercifully to incline thine eare#
to v# that haue made now our prayer# and
supplication# vnto thee, & grant that those thing#
which we haue faithfully asked, according to thy will, may
effectually be obtained to the relief of our necessitie, and to the
setting foorth of thy glory through Jesu# Christ our Lord.
Amen.
