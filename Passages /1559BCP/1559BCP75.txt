order of Deacons, and that done, hee ſhall ſay vnto them,
which are appointed to receiue the ſaid office, as hereafter
followeth.
Ou haue heard b°eth°en, aƒwell in youre p°iuate examination,
as in the exho°tation, and in the holy Le±ons taken out of the Goƒpel, and of the w°itings of the Apo¥les, of what dignity, and of
how great impo°tance this o¤ice is, (whereunto yee be called). And now wee exho°t you, in the Name of our Lo°d Jeƒus Chri¥, to haue
in rememb°ance into how high a dignity, and to how chargeable an
o¤ice yee be called, that is to ƒay, to be the me±engers, the watchmen,
the Pa¥ours, and the Stewards of the Lo¥d to teach, to p°emoniƒhe,
to feede, and p°ouid for the Lo°ds family: to ƒeek for
Ch°i¥s ƒheepe that be diƒperƒed ab°oad, and fo° his child°en which bee
in the midde¥ of this naughty wo°ld, to bee ƒaued th°ough Ch°i¥ fo°
euer. Haue alwayes therfo°e p°inted in your rememb°ance how
great a treaƒure is committed to your charge, fo° they be the ƒheepe
of Ch°i¥, which hee bought with his death, and fo° whom he ƒhed his
blood. The Churche and Congregation whom you mu¥ ƒerue, is
his ƒpouƒe and his body.
And if it ƒhall chance the ƒame Church, o° any membre therof, to
take any hurt or hinderance, by reaƒon of youre negligence, yee
A
Y 
know the greatne±e of the fault, and alƒo of the ho°rible puniƒhment
which will enƒue. Wherfo°e, conƒider with your ƒelues the end of
your mini¥ery, towards the child°en of God, towards the ƒpouƒe
and body of Ch°i¥, and ƒee that you neuer ceaƒe your labour, your care, and diligence, vntill you haue doen all that lieth in you, acco°ding
to your bounden duety, to b°ing all ƒuch as are, o° shall be
committed to your charge, vnto that agreement in faith, and knowledge
of God, and to that ripene±e and perfectne±e of age in Ch°i¥,
that there be no place left among you, either for errour in Religion,
o° fo° viciouƒne±e in life.
Then, fo°aƒmuch as your o¤ice is both of ƒo greate excellencie,
and of ƒo great di¤icultie, ye ƒee with how great care and ¥udy yee
ought to apply your ƒelues, aƒwell that you may ƒhewe your ƒelues
kind to that Lo°d, who hath placed you in so high a dignity, as alƒo
to beware, that neither you your ƒelues o¤end, neither be occaƒion
that other o¤end. Howbeit, ye cannot haue a mind and a wil thereto
of your ƒelues, fo° that power and ability is giuen of God alone.
Therefo°e ye ƒee how ye ought and haue need, earne¥ly to pray fo°
his holy Spirit. And ƒeeing that you cannot by any other meanes compa±e the doing of ƒo weighty a wo°ke pertaining to the ƒaluation
of man, but with doctrine and exho°tacion, taken out of holy Scriptures,
and with a life agreeable unto the ƒame. Ye perceiue how ¥udious yee ought to bee in reading and learning the Scriptures,
and in framing the manners, both of your ƒelues, and of them that
ƒpecially pertaine vnto you, acco°ding to the rule of the ƒame
Scriptures: And fo° this ƒelfe ƒame cauƒe, ye ƒee how yee ought to fo°ƒake and ƒet aƒide (as much as you maye) all wo°ldly cares and ¥udies.
We haue a good hope, that you haue well weighed and pondered
theƒe things with your ƒelues, long befo°e this time, and that you
haue clearly determined, by Gods grace, to giue your ƒelues wholly
to this vocation, wherunto it hath pleaƒed God to call you, ƒo that
(as muche as lieth in you) you apply your ƒelues wholly to this
one thing, and d°aw all your cares and ¥udies this way, and to this
