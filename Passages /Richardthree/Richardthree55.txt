Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.
BUCKINGHAM
Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,
But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,
Than I of yours;
Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.
Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.
HASTINGS
I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;
But, for his purpose in the coronation.
I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
His gracious pleasure any way therein:
But you, my noble lords, may name the time;
And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,
Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.
Enter GLOUCESTER

BISHOP OF ELY
Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.
GLOUCESTER
My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.
I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
My absence doth neglect no great designs,
Which by my presence might have been concluded.
BUCKINGHAM
Had not you come upon your cue, my lord
William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,--
I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.
GLOUCESTER
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;
His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.
HASTINGS
I thank your grace.
GLOUCESTER
My lord of Ely!
BISHOP OF ELY
My lord?
GLOUCESTER
When I was last in Holborn,
I saw good strawberries in your garden there
I do beseech you send for some of them.
BISHOP OF ELY
Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.
Exit

GLOUCESTER
Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
Drawing him aside

Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
