Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.
GLOUCESTER
Would you enforce me to a world of care?
Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,
But penetrable to your. kind entreats,
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest

Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,
Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,
I must have patience to endure the load:
But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
Attend the sequel of your imposition,
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
For God he knows, and you may partly see,
How far I am from the desire thereof.
Lord Mayor
God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.
GLOUCESTER
In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
BUCKINGHAM
Then I salute you with this kingly title:
Long live Richard, England's royal king!
Lord Mayor Citizens
Amen.
BUCKINGHAM
To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?
GLOUCESTER
Even when you please, since you will have it so.
BUCKINGHAM
To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:
And so most joyfully we take our leave.
GLOUCESTER
Come, let us to our holy task again.
Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.
Exeunt

DUCHESS OF YORK
Who m eets us here? my niece Plantagenet
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,
On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.
Daughter, well met.
