Cup us, till the world go round!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,
Let me request you off: our graver business
Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;
You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb
Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue
Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost
Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
Good Antony, your hand.
POMPEY
I'll try you on the shore.
MARK ANTONY
And shall, sir; give's your hand.
POMPEY
O Antony,
You have my father's house,--But, what? we are friends.
Come, down into the boat.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Take heed you fall not.
Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and MENAS

Menas, I'll not on shore.
MENAS
No, to my cabin.
These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!
Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
To these great fellows: sound and be hang'd, sound out!
Sound a flourish, with drums

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Ho! says a' There's my cap.
MENAS
Ho! Noble captain, come.
Exeunt

ACT III

SCENE I. A plain in Syria.

Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph, with SILIUS, and other Romans, Officers, and Soldiers; the dead body of PACORUS borne before him
VENTIDIUS
Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now
Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body
Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
Pays this for Marcus Crassus.
SILIUS
Noble Ventidius,
Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,
