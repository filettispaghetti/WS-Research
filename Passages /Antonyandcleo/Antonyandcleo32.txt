CLEOPATRA
Well said.
Messenger
And friends with Caesar.
CLEOPATRA
Thou'rt an honest man.
Messenger
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
CLEOPATRA
Make thee a fortune from me.
Messenger
But yet, madam,--
CLEOPATRA
I do not like 'But yet,' it does allay
The good precedence; fie upon 'But yet'!
'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar:
In state of health thou say'st; and thou say'st free.
Messenger
Free, madam! no; I made no such report:
He's bound unto Octavia.
CLEOPATRA
For what good turn?
Messenger
For the best turn i' the bed.
CLEOPATRA
I am pale, Charmian.
Messenger
Madam, he's married to Octavia.
CLEOPATRA
The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
Strikes him down

Messenger
Good madam, patience.
CLEOPATRA
What say you? Hence,
Strikes him again

Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes
Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head:
She hales him up and down

Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire, and stew'd in brine,
Smarting in lingering pickle.
Messenger
Gracious madam,
I that do bring the news made not the match.
