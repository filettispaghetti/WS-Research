What it is worth embraced.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
And what may follow,
To try a larger fortune.
POMPEY
You have made me offer
Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon
To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back
Our targes undinted.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR MARK ANTONY LEPIDUS
That's our offer.
POMPEY
Know, then,
I came before you here a man prepared
To take this offer: but Mark Antony
Put me to some impatience: though I lose
The praise of it by telling, you must know,
When Caesar and your brother were at blows,
Your mother came to Sicily and did find
Her welcome friendly.
MARK ANTONY
I have heard it, Pompey;
And am well studied for a liberal thanks
Which I do owe you.
POMPEY
Let me have your hand:
I did not think, sir, to have met you here.
MARK ANTONY
The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,
That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;
For I have gain'd by 't.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Since I saw you last,
There is a change upon you.
POMPEY
Well, I know not
What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;
But in my bosom shall she never come,
To make my heart her vassal.
LEPIDUS
Well met here.
POMPEY
I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:
I crave our composition may be written,
And seal'd between us.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
That's the next to do.
POMPEY
