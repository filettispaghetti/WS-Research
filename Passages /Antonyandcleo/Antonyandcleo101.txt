Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,
Thou wouldst have mercy on me.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Forbear, Seleucus.
Exit SELEUCUS

CLEOPATRA
Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought
For things that others do; and, when we fall,
We answer others' merits in our name,
Are therefore to be pitied.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Cleopatra,
Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged,
Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours,
Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,
Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you
Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;
Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;
For we intend so to dispose you as
Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:
Our care and pity is so much upon you,
That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.
CLEOPATRA
My master, and my lord!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Not so. Adieu.
Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and his train

CLEOPATRA
He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not
Be noble to myself: but, hark thee, Charmian.
Whispers CHARMIAN

IRAS
Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,
And we are for the dark.
CLEOPATRA
Hie thee again:
I have spoke already, and it is provided;
Go put it to the haste.
CHARMIAN
Madam, I will.
Re-enter DOLABELLA

DOLABELLA
Where is the queen?
CHARMIAN
Behold, sir.
Exit
