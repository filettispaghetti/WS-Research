his discretion.
Second Servant
Why, this is to have a name in great men's
fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do
me no service as a partisan I could not heave.
First Servant
To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen
to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be,
which pitifully disaster the cheeks.
A sennet sounded. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MECAENAS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MENAS, with other captains

MARK ANTONY
[To OCTAVIUS CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take
the flow o' the Nile
By certain scales i' the pyramid; they know,
By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth
Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,
The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman
Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
And shortly comes to harvest.
LEPIDUS
You've strange serpents there.
MARK ANTONY
Ay, Lepidus.
LEPIDUS
Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
operation of your sun: so is your crocodile.
MARK ANTONY
They are so.
POMPEY
Sit,--and some wine! A health to Lepidus!
LEPIDUS
I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.
LEPIDUS
Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies'
pyramises are very goodly things; without
contradiction, I have heard that.
MENAS
[Aside to POMPEY] Pompey, a word.
POMPEY
[Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear:
what is't?
MENAS
[Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech
thee, captain,
And hear me speak a word.
POMPEY
[Aside to MENAS] Forbear me till anon.
