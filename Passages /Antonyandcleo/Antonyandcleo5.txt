I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
ALEXAS
Nay, hear him.
CHARMIAN
Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married
to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:
let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry
may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius
Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.
Soothsayer
You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
CHARMIAN
O excellent! I love long life better than figs.
Soothsayer
You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune
Than that which is to approach.
CHARMIAN
Then belike my children shall have no names:
prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?
Soothsayer
If every of your wishes had a womb.
And fertile every wish, a million.
CHARMIAN
Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
ALEXAS
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
CHARMIAN
Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
ALEXAS
We'll know all our fortunes.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall
be--drunk to bed.
IRAS
There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.
CHARMIAN
E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.
IRAS
Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
CHARMIAN
Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful
prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,
tell her but a worky-day fortune.
Soothsayer
Your fortunes are alike.
IRAS
But how, but how? give me particulars.
Soothsayer
I have said.
IRAS
