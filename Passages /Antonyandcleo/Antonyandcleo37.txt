We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's
Draw lots who shall begin.
MARK ANTONY
That will I, Pompey.
POMPEY
No, Antony, take the lot: but, first
Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
Grew fat with feasting there.
MARK ANTONY
You have heard much.
POMPEY
I have fair meanings, sir.
MARK ANTONY
And fair words to them.
POMPEY
Then so much have I heard:
And I have heard, Apollodorus carried--
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
No more of that: he did so.
POMPEY
What, I pray you?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
POMPEY
I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Well;
And well am like to do; for, I perceive,
Four feasts are toward.
POMPEY
Let me shake thy hand;
I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,
When I have envied thy behavior.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Sir,
I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,
When you have well deserved ten times as much
As I have said you did.
POMPEY
Enjoy thy plainness,
It nothing ill becomes thee.
Aboard my galley I invite you all:
Will you lead, lords?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR MARK ANTONY LEPIDUS
Show us the way, sir.
POMPEY
Come.
Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUS
