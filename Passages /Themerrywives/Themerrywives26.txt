stand upon your honour! Why, thou unconfinable
baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the
terms of my honour precise: I, I, I myself
sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand
and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to
shuffle, to hedge and to lurch; and yet you, rogue,
will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain
looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your
bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of your
honour! You will not do it, you!
PISTOL
I do relent: what would thou more of man?
Enter ROBIN

ROBIN
Sir, here's a woman would speak with you.
FALSTAFF
Let her approach.
Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY

MISTRESS QUICKLY
Give your worship good morrow.
FALSTAFF
Good morrow, good wife.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
Not so, an't please your worship.
FALSTAFF
Good maid, then.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
I'll be sworn,
As my mother was, the first hour I was born.
FALSTAFF
I do believe the swearer. What with me?
MISTRESS QUICKLY
Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?
FALSTAFF
Two thousand, fair woman: and I'll vouchsafe thee
the hearing.
MISTRESS QUICKLY
There is one Mistress Ford, sir:--I pray, come a
little nearer this ways:--I myself dwell with master
Doctor Caius,--
FALSTAFF
Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say,--
MISTRESS QUICKLY
Your worship says very true: I pray your worship,
come a little nearer this ways.
FALSTAFF
I warrant thee, nobody hears; mine own people, mine
own people.
