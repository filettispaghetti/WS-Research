
[Enter Ross and Angus.]

Who comes here?

MALCOLM  The worthy Thane of Ross.

LENNOX
What a haste looks through his eyes!
So should he look that seems to speak things
strange.

ROSS  God save the King.

DUNCAN  Whence cam'st thou, worthy thane?

ROSS  From Fife, great king,
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
And fan our people cold.
Norway himself, with terrible numbers,
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,
The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,
Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapped in proof,
Confronted him with self-comparisons,
Point against point, rebellious arm 'gainst arm,
Curbing his lavish spirit. And to conclude,
The victory fell on us.

DUNCAN  Great happiness!

ROSS  That now Sweno,
The Norways' king, craves composition.
Nor would we deign him burial of his men
Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's Inch
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.

DUNCAN
No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
Our bosom interest. Go, pronounce his present
death,
And with his former title greet Macbeth.

ROSS  I'll see it done.

DUNCAN
What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.
