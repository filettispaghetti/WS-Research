Cool it with a baboon's blood.
Then the charm is firm and good.

[Enter Hecate to the other three Witches.]


HECATE
O, well done! I commend your pains,
And everyone shall share i' th' gains.
And now about the cauldron sing
Like elves and fairies in a ring,
Enchanting all that you put in.
[Music and a song: "Black Spirits," etc. Hecate exits.]

SECOND WITCH
By the pricking of my thumbs,
Something wicked this way comes.
Open, locks,
Whoever knocks.

[Enter Macbeth.]


MACBETH
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags?
What is 't you do?

ALL  A deed without a name.

MACBETH
I conjure you by that which you profess
(Howe'er you come to know it), answer me.
Though you untie the winds and let them fight
Against the churches, though the yeasty waves
Confound and swallow navigation up,
Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown
down,
Though castles topple on their warders' heads,
Though palaces and pyramids do slope
Their heads to their foundations, though the
treasure
Of nature's germens tumble all together
Even till destruction sicken, answer me
To what I ask you.

FIRST WITCH  Speak.

SECOND WITCH  Demand.

THIRD WITCH  We'll answer.
