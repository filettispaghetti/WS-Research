To spoil the city and your royal court.
BUCKINGHAM
Then linger not, my lord, away, take horse.
KING HENRY VI
Come, Margaret; God, our hope, will succor us.
QUEEN MARGARET
My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceased.
KING HENRY VI
Farewell, my lord: trust not the Kentish rebels.
BUCKINGHAM
Trust nobody, for fear you be betray'd.
SAY
The trust I have is in mine innocence,
And therefore am I bold and resolute.
Exeunt

SCENE V. London. The Tower.

Enter SCALES upon the Tower, walking. Then enter two or three Citizens below
SCALES
How now! is Jack Cade slain?
First Citizen
No, my lord, nor likely to be slain; for they have
won the bridge, killing all those that withstand
them: the lord mayor craves aid of your honour from
the Tower, to defend the city from the rebels.
SCALES
Such aid as I can spare you shall command;
But I am troubled here with them myself;
The rebels have assay'd to win the Tower.
But get you to Smithfield, and gather head,
And thither I will send you Matthew Goffe;
Fight for your king, your country and your lives;
And so, farewell, for I must hence again.
Exeunt

SCENE VI. London. Cannon Street.

Enter CADE and the rest, and strikes his staff on London-stone
CADE
Now is Mortimer lord of this city. And here, sitting
upon London-stone, I charge and command that, of the
city's cost, the pissing-conduit run nothing but
claret wine this first year of our reign. And now
henceforward it shall be treason for any that calls
me other than Lord Mortimer.
Enter a Soldier, running

Soldier
Jack Cade! Jack Cade!
