O barbarous and bloody spectacle!
His body will I bear unto the king:
If he revenge it not, yet will his friends;
So will the queen, that living held him dear.
Exit with the body

SCENE II. Blackheath.

Enter GEORGE BEVIS and JOHN HOLLAND
BEVIS
Come, and get thee a sword, though made of a lath;
they have been up these two days.
HOLLAND
They have the more need to sleep now, then.
BEVIS
I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier means to dress
the commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it.
HOLLAND
So he had need, for 'tis threadbare. Well, I say it
was never merry world in England since gentlemen came up.
BEVIS
O miserable age! virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men.
HOLLAND
The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.
BEVIS
Nay, more, the king's council are no good workmen.
HOLLAND
True; and yet it is said, labour in thy vocation;
which is as much to say as, let the magistrates be
labouring men; and therefore should we be
magistrates.
BEVIS
Thou hast hit it; for there's no better sign of a
brave mind than a hard hand.
HOLLAND
I see them! I see them! there's Best's son, the
tanner of Wingham,--
BEVIS
He shall have the skin of our enemies, to make
dog's-leather of.
HOLLAND
And Dick the Butcher,--
BEVIS
Then is sin struck down like an ox, and iniquity's
throat cut like a calf.
HOLLAND
And Smith the weaver,--
BEVIS
Argo, their thread of life is spun.
HOLLAND
