Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children.
DEMETRIUS
This is a witness that I am thy son.
Stabs BASSIANUS

CHIRON
And this for me, struck home to show my strength.
Also stabs BASSIANUS, who dies

LAVINIA
Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora,
For no name fits thy nature but thy own!
TAMORA
Give me thy poniard; you shall know, my boys
Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.
DEMETRIUS
Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her;
First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw:
This minion stood upon her chastity,
Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,
And with that painted hope braves your mightiness:
And shall she carry this unto her grave?
CHIRON
An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.
Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.
TAMORA
But when ye have the honey ye desire,
Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.
CHIRON
I warrant you, madam, we wil l make that sure.
Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy
That nice-preserved honesty of yours.
LAVINIA
O Tamora! thou bear'st a woman's face,--
TAMORA
I will not hear her speak; away with her!
LAVINIA
Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.
DEMETRIUS
Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory
To see her tears; but be your heart to them
As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.
LAVINIA
When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?
O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee;
The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble;
Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.
Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:
To CHIRON
