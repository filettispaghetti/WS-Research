Enter MARCUS

Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius;
Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths:
Bid him repair to me, and bring with him
Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths;
Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are:
Tell him the emperor and the empress too
Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them.
This do thou for my love; and so let him,
As he regards his aged father's life.
MARCUS ANDRONICUS
This will I do, and soon return again.
Exit

TAMORA
Now will I hence about thy business,
And take my ministers along with me.
TITUS ANDRONICUS
Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me;
Or else I'll call my brother back again,
And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.
TAMORA
[Aside to her sons] What say you, boys? will you
bide with him,
Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor
How I have govern'd our determined jest?
Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,
And tarry with him till I turn again.
TITUS ANDRONICUS
[Aside] I know them all, though they suppose me mad,
And will o'erreach them in their own devices:
A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam!
DEMETRIUS
Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.
TAMORA
Farewell, Andronicus: Revenge now goes
To lay a complot to betray thy foes.
TITUS ANDRONICUS
I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.
Exit TAMORA

CHIRON
Tell us, old man, how shall we be employ'd?
TITUS ANDRONICUS
Tut, I have work enough for you to do.
Publius, come hither, Caius, and Valentine!
