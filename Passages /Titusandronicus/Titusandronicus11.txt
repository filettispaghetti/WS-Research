If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths,
She will a handmaid be to his desires,
A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.
SATURNINUS
Ascend, fair queen, Pantheon. Lords, accompany
Your noble emperor and his lovely bride,
Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,
Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered:
There shall we consummate our spousal rites.
Exeunt all but TITUS

TITUS ANDRONICUS
I am not bid to wait upon this bride.
Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone,
Dishonour'd thus, and challenged of wrongs?
Re-enter MARCUS, LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS

MARCUS ANDRONICUS
O Titus, see, O, see what thou hast done!
In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.
TITUS ANDRONICUS
No, foolish tribune, no; no son of mine,
Nor thou, nor these, confederates in the deed
That hath dishonour'd all our family;
Unworthy brother, and unworthy sons!
LUCIUS
But let us give him burial, as becomes;
Give Mutius burial with our brethren.
TITUS ANDRONICUS
Traitors, away! he rests not in this tomb:
This monument five hundred years hath stood,
Which I have sumptuously re-edified:
Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors
Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
Bury him where you can; he comes not here.
MARCUS ANDRONICUS
My lord, this is impiety in you:
My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him
He must be buried with his brethren.
QUINTUS MARTIUS
And shall, or him we will accompany.
TITUS ANDRONICUS
'And shall!' what villain was it that spake
that word?
QUINTUS
He that would vouch it in any place but here.
TITUS ANDRONICUS
What, would you bury him in my despite?
MARCUS ANDRONICUS
No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee
