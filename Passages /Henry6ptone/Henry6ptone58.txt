Come, side by side together live and die.
And soul with soul from France to heaven fly.

To my determined time thou gavest new date.
TALBOT

It warm'd thy father's heart with proud desire
Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age,
Quicken'd with youthful spleen and warlike rage,
Beat down Alencon, Orleans, Burgundy,
