Ihesus clamabat (Qui habet aures audiendi audiat) 
Luc. viij.

THyse wordes ben wryten in the go∣spell of this daye. And thus to be englysshed. Ih̄u our sauyour made a proclamacōn with a hyghe & gre∣te voyce to the people that came to here hym / sayenge. Euery man whi¦che hath eeres of herynge may yf he be well dyspo¦sed here what is sayd vnto hym. ¶ Bede sayth that thyse wordes ben oft tyme repetyd both in the gos∣pelles & in the appocalypsis / and hath in them gre¦te mysterye of ye pleasure of god almyghty. ¶ Saȳt Ierom in the chapytre vpon Iohn sheweth that all the sermons & prechynges that Cryste Ihesu made he sayd them (cū magno clamore) by the whiche he certyfyed the people that he preched vnto the grete zele & affeccyon that he had to the wele of ther sou∣les / & that they sholde be desyrous to here the wor∣de of god / by the whiche they sholde be delyuered fro all mortalyte and be made by it (filias dei per adopcionē) ¶ Fyue proclamacōns specyally ma∣de by Cryste Ih̄u. I note in his holy gospelles / whi¦che ben of that auctoryte / that who so euer wol not here them & indeuour hym to kepe them / shall ne∣uer come to euerlastynge Ioye. Wherfore frendes geue better eere & take more hede to them. ¶ The fyrst proclamacōn I note in the gospel of this daye

where he called the people that came fro cytees / townes & borughes / & shewed to them a parable of sede whiche was sowe in dyuerse places not conue¦nyent for the growynge therof / & perysshed / but yt whiche was sowe in good tylth & erth / multeplyed & encresed meruayllously to the grete ryches of him that sewe it. Cryste Ihesu calleth this sede his wor∣de by the whiche all thynge is made & multeplyed & hath theyr beynge as it is wryten. i. q. i. Inter ca¦tholicam. Oīm rerū recreacio et oīm recreacio fuit in verbo. Psal. Verbo dm̄ celi firmati sūt. Et gene. i. Dixit et facta sunt. et. xxxiij. q. h. c. Quid ergo. ¶ And ryght as sedes sowe bryngeth forth infeny∣te corne to the sustenaūce of man. Ryght so the wor¦de of god sowen in mannes soule bryngeth forth in¦fenyte vertues / as is noted. i. q. i. c. (Interrogo vos) ¶ Man is the perfeccyon of the hole werke of god. He made heuen & creatures celestyall Inuysyble to vs that be mortall creatures here in erth. And ma∣de man & other creatures here in erthe terrestryall / but the perfeccōn of his werke is the coniunccōn of the soule whiche is celestyall / to the body that is ter¦restryall / for the whiche body all thynge that is ma¦de here in erthe / as tree / fruyte / beestes / foule & fys∣she and all other are create to fede & serue the body the body to serue the soule / and the soule oonly to serue almyghty god. And therfore it is wryten (de penitencijs dist. i. recreat{us}. Sicut aīa est vita corpo∣ris. ita deus est vita aīe) ¶ And ryght as almyghty
Page  [unnumbered]
god hath purueyed for mete to the sustenaunce of the body / in lyke wyse he hath ordeyned spyrytuall meete for the sustenaūce of the soule / whiche is his worde / as he sayth Math. iiijo. (and wryten extra de officio. or. c. Inter cetera. Non ī solo pane viuit ho¦mo. sed in ōni verbo qd {pro}¦cedit de ore dei) ¶ By the vertue of his blessyd worde / he hath ordeyned yt the materyall brede whiche fedeth the body / shall be transformed in to his flesshe & blood / and it to be most precyous mete to fede ye soule of man. Ther∣fore Dauyd sayth in the psalme. Afferte dn̄o. Vox dm̄ in magnificencia. That is to be vnderstonde / that the voys of the worde of our lorde hath ye ver∣tue of magnyfycence / that is whan his seruaunt in due fourme accordyng to his lawe ordened & sayth the wordes vpon the materyall brede / there is that magnyfycence in the wordes that incōtynenty / that whiche was materyall brede is conuerted in to his flesshe / & the materyall wyne in to his blood. Whi∣che season the angelles in heuen in ye Immolacyon ben there present in mynystrynge & doynge sacrefy∣ce to theyr maker / as it is wryten (de con. dist. ij. Quis fideliū) And of this ye sholde not gretly mer¦uayle. For a yonge mayden our lady saynt Mary whan she sayd thyse. v. wordes. Fiat michi scdm verbū tuū. God & man were knytte togyder in her wombe. And so (verbū caro factū est) In lykewyse whan ye preest sayth thyse. v. wordes (hoc est em̄ cor∣pus meū) there is togyder in that materyall hoste

god & man / the same whiche was born of our lady & hanged vpon the crosse / that rose from deth to lyf & ascended to heuen. And is & shalbe (iudex viuo{rum} et mortuo{rum}) And all faythfull crysten men whiche in true lyf & fayth ben fed with it (viuūt ī eternū) And so it is (viaticū) to strength mannes soule to come (ad montē oreb) to the presence of the trynyte De{us} fecit ex bonitate celū & terrā. ex {con}passione re∣demit gen{us} hūanū. ex {per}missione misit in terrā spm̄ scm̄. et ex sua sūma caritate quotidie pascit nos ei{us} cor{per}e & sanguīe vt essem{us} caro de carne eius et os de ossi{bus}) So frendes who so hereth this proclamacōn thus made by the sone of god / and called to ete of this blessyd meete & wyll not / he shall neuer come to heuen. The seconde proclamacōn that Cryst made is wryten (Ioh̄. vijo. &. xxxiij. q. h. tūc saluabit{ur}) where he sayd (Si qis sitit venit ad me & bibet) who so euer lyste drynke lete hym come & drynke of my drynke / & he shal neuer after be thursty. For ryght as he called them before to ete of his brede / ryght so now he calleth theym to drynke of his drynke. This drynke frendes is the blessyd blood & water yt was lete out of Crystis syde whan he hanged on the crosse / clene blood of our redempcōn / & clere wa¦ter of our regeneracōn. And not (flegma) as the he¦retyke sayth / as is declared (de Sū. tri. et fi. catho. in clc.) And of this blood & water yt passed out of Crystys syde all the sacramentes of the chirche / in whom all our saluacōn & helth lyeth in / hath theyr

Vox dm̄ su{per} aquas. de{us} maiestat{is} intonuit dn̄s su{per} aquas mul∣tas) & ryght as whan Cryst was baptyzed / the fad{er} shewed his pleasure (in voce) ye sone (in carne nrā) & the holy ghost (in spē colūbe) And all ye angelles were there present at ye reuerence of the Instytucōn of that sacrament. Ryght soo at this season at the baptysyng of euery crysten creature / is ye holy tryny¦te present with angelles. And there is infused in ye soule of yt crysten creature (tres virtutes theologice Fides. spes. et caritas) As is noted in the sayd (cle¦mentine de Sū. tri. et fi. catho) So frendes who so euer may be baptyzed in water & wyll not / he shall not come in heuen. The thyrde proclamacyon made by our sauyour Cryste Ih̄us is wryten (Ioh. xio. et. xiij. q. ij. c. Qui diuina. et de pe. dist. vi. c. io.) Whan he reysed Lazar from deth to lyf cryenge wt a grete voys (Lazare veni foras) And incontynent at the cōmaundement of his worde / the soule that was (in limbo) resorted to the body & gaue it lyfe. Cryst sayeng to his dyscyples (Soluite eū & sinite abite) Euery man beynge in dedely synne frendes is deed in the syght of god. And as Ancelme sayth
Page  [unnumbered]
amonge all-the people of the worlde is none more odyous / than a traytour to the kyng / & all the peo∣ple feereth to deale with hym. And in lyke wyse he that is in dedely synne / is odyous to all creatures for his Ingratytude & dysobeysaunce to almyghty god / as is noted. xxiij. q. iij. Sex. Yet lete no man dyspeyre / yf he woll come at the callynge of Cryste And yf he be in neuer so grete synne & wretchednes His worde is of that effecte & hath grace & vertue whiche taketh awaye all synne / & breketh the yates of helle & all the power therof. And therof Dauyd sayth in the psalme aboue reherced. Vox dm̄ con∣fringent{is} cedros. Thyse wordes ben the wordes of our lorde / whan the preest sayth those wordes (Ego absoluo te a peccat{is} tuis) The hyghe trees of cedre pryde / enuye / Ire / couetyse / with all other capytall synnes / are destroyed / & neuer shall appere to hurte hym whiche is confessyd of theym. This proclama¦cyon frendes is of that necessyte / that who so euer may be confessyd to a preest (in forma eccl̄ie) and wyll not / he shall neuer come to heuen. ¶ The fourth proclamacōn Cryste made whan he hanged vpon the crosse & made his prayer to his fad{er} for al synners yt wolde byleue yt he was god & man / whan he sayd thyse wordes. Dimitte eis qr nesciūt quid faciūt. Luce. xxiijo. et. xxv. q. v. S. io.

For ryght as a harte desyreth for his helpe ye water / ryght so mā∣nes soule hauynge this sacrament desyreth pryncy¦pally heuen. This sacrament is deprecatori & ston¦deth in prayer ryght as Cryst prayed vpon ye crosse So in mynystracōn of this sacrament ye preest ane∣lynge dyuerse partes of mannes body besecheth al∣myghty god / that what soo euer this creature hath offended in his hert / by his eyen / his eeres / his hon∣des & fete / or ony other parte by the whiche he hath dyspleased hym / to forgeue hym (vt extra de sacra. vnctōe. c. vnico) And so who so wol not receyue this sacrament & may / shall not come to ye glory of he∣uen. The fyfth proclamacōn shall be made by cōmaūdement of Cryst Ihesu whiche is (rex et pon¦tifex) at the daye of dome / as is redde Math. xxvo. Media nocte clamor fact{us} ē) at whiche voys & crye all mankynde / aswell (fideles as infideles) shal ry¦se wt the same bodyes whiche they haue here now / and they shall be incorruptyble. And all faythfull crysten men whiche hath kept Crystys proclamacy¦ons shall receyue euerlastynge Ioye by the sentence of Cryste Ihesu (pontificis) to whom oonly ye pro∣nuncyacōn of the Iugement is geuen Sayeng Ve∣nite bn̄dicti patris mei {per}cipite regnū qd paratū est vobis ab origīe mūdi. de pe. dist. iij. c. ad huc instant in gl̄o. And so to receyue euerlastynge Ioye / & to be

confermed in the same. This proclamacōn & sen∣tence representeth the sacrament of Confyrmacōn. whiche muste oonly be done by a bysshop as is wry¦ten (i. c. vnic. de sacra. vncc) And in that (dant{ur} grā et robur vt de cō. dist. ij. oēs) ¶ And though it be so yt a man baptysed deye are he be confermed / he shal haue euerlastynge Ioye / but not so plenarye as he sholde haue yf he were confermed. ¶ It is ordey∣ned by the chirche / that a childe confermed / by the space of thre dayes shal bere a shred or bende abou¦te the necke / in token he is become a seruaūt of thre persones & one god / the fader / the sone / & the holy ghoost. And therfore Dauyd spekynge of this sa∣crament / calleth it the sacrament of grete vertue & grace for the stable confyrmacyon therof sayenge. Vox dm̄ in virtute. ¶ And who so euer may recey¦ue this sacrament & woll not / he shall neuer entre the kyngdom of heuē. ¶ Ther ben other two sa∣cramentes instytute by Cryste Ih̄u / whiche ben put in mannes wyll to receyue them or naye. And they taken byndeth the takers to obserue theym vnd{er} the payne of theyr dampnacōn. Whiche ben the sacra∣ment of matrymony & ordre. Of the sacrament of matrymony speketh Dauyd in ye fore reherced psal¦me sayenge Vox dm̄ int̄cedent{is} flāmā ignis. The flame of cucupyscence of the flesshe in fornycacyon whiche is dedely synne. By this sacrament of ma∣trymony yt mortalyte of synne is torned in to veny∣al in dyuerse cases (vt. xxvi. dist. deinde. &. xxxij. q. ij.

Sicut. Et qd ip̄e de{us} ē cust{is} & defensor mat̄mo. xxxij q. iiij. nemo ī fi. ¶ And ye sacrament of ordre is ye se∣conde whiche is put in mānes eleccyon / in the whi∣che (imprimit{ur} caracter indebilis & dat{ur} special grā) And he ordred specyally to be mynystre of al other sacramentes. ¶ Of this ordre & power therof spe∣keth Dauyd in ye aboue sayd psalme sayeng. Vox dm̄ {con}mouentis desertū. Whiche deserte this worlde is called. And his offyce is mankynde lyuynge in it to informe & meue with his good example of ly∣uynge & holy doctryne (increpando. arguendo. ex∣hortando. et {con}minando) And they ben ordred to lo¦ue god pryncypally as is noted. h. q. iij. Qui ep̄s. ¶ I haue shewed vnto you thyse fyue proclamacy¦ons / whiche must be kept vnd{er} payne of your damp¦nacyon. Wherfore I saye to you with Cryste. Qui habet aures audiendi audiat) yt is to saye. Ye yt he∣re the worde of god / here it deuoutly & prynte it in your soules perfytly / & execute it acordynge to ye sa∣me. ¶ God almyghty frendes neuer lefte man without remedy for the saluacōn of his soule / as in the olde Testament was circūcysyon & sacrefyce of beestes & other after the fourme thenne geuen / whi¦che were expyacōns for synne for yt season / but they had no vertu to open heuen yates & brynge man in ¶ And there whan he ascended (cor{per}alr) he lefte in his chirche the. vij. sacramentes in the remembraū∣ce of his passyon and to haue theyr vertue of de sa∣me / as is wryten in the chapytre (cū martha de ce

missa{rum}) ¶ He left also his moder here behynde hȳ whiche lyued dyuerse yeres after hym to instructe ye Appostles & Euangelystes of his incarnacōn & his blessyd lyfe & cōmaūdementes / & therfore she is cal¦led (mater eccl̄ie). ¶ And as ye grete doctour Alber¦tus sayth vpon the gospell (Missus est angelus ga¦briel) that our lady receyued all the sacramentes of the chirche excepte preesthode / for thre causes. The fyrst was ({pro}pter hūiliacionē) where yt our fyrst mo¦der Eue was condempned for her pryde / she in her lyf shewed al mekenes & wolde be amonge wȳmen as one of them. And so wolde be after the lawe pu¦refyed though she neded it not / but be as one of thē a moder lyke as her sone Cryste Ih̄u wolde be cir∣cumcysed as a childe as Saynt Bernarde sayth. ¶ The seconde cause was ({pro}pt{er} instruccōem alio{rum}) that by her ensample euery man & woman sholde receyue theyr sacrament{is} / wtout whiche they myght not be saued. For why / her sone had sayd as is wry¦ten (Math̄ vltīo) geuynge his appostles in cōmaū∣dement Eūtes docete oēs gētes baptisantes ī noīe prīs & fi. et ss. docentes eos seruare q̄cū{que} mandaui vobis. ¶ The thyrde cause ({pro}pter su{per}errogacionē) as is wryten Apocalipsis vltīo. Qui iust{us} est. iusti ficet{ur} adhuc. ¶ And though it be so yt she was (ab inicio sanctificata ex vtero matris. et plena grā. et magis repleta in {con}cepcōe filij sui) And though she neded not to receyue the sacramēt{is} for purgacōn of synne / yet she receyued them (vt cresceret {per} effectū
Page  [unnumbered]
sacramēto{rum}) ¶ She wolde be baptyzed as her sone was & so receyue (carectarē baptismalem) And be nombred amonge crysten people / & dystyncte from the Iewes. ¶ She was confessyd to the Euange∣lyst of no synne / but geuynge laude & praysynge to almyghty god / that it pleas•… hym to make her his moder beynge his creature. ¶ Also she receyued of the sayd saynt Ioh̄n whiche sayd masse before her and mynystred to her the same body / whiche was born of her. Ioyned to the godhede in remembraū∣ce of his passyon / & to her grete consolacyon in his absence. And so al other sacramentes except preest∣hode as is aboue sayd she receyued / whiche is to the stablysshement & confyrmacōn of the sacramentes of the chirche and the veryte & truthe of the same / & to the confusyon of all Heretykes. And therfore we synge in the chirche Gaude maria v{er}go cūctas hereses tu sola interemisti. This is noted by Anto∣nyne (in quarta {per}te titlo. xvo. c. xvio.) ¶ Ye knowe ryght wel brethern that credence is not to be geuen to no proclamacōn but to yt / whiche cometh by the kynges hyghe cōmaundement & vnder his seale / & the more honourable persone that bryngeth & pro∣clameth it / the more credence ought to be geuen to it. Proclamacōns ben made in dyuerse places of ye cytees & londe / to the entent they sholde be well vn∣derstonde / & noo man after to alledge Ignoraunce therof. To ye transgressours & brekers therof som∣tyme the penalyte is treason / somtyme deth / inpry∣sonement

& losse of theyr goodes as the lawe assyg¦neth in that behalf / noted (extra de constit. c. fīali) ¶ Thyse proclamacyons frendes ought to be ac∣cepte aboue all other / for they come from the kyng of all kynges almyghty god / as is red apocalipsis (xixo. et de const. iiij. c. {pro}prie. et de re. iudic. c. ij. in. cle) ¶ This gloryous godheed stondeth in thre perso∣nes / the fader / the sone / & the holy ghost (Pater est de{us}. fili{us} ē deus. spiritus scūs ē deus) Also of one es∣sence nature & power / and who so euer dyspleaseth one / dyspleaseth all (qr tres illi vnū sūt) & no man may resyste hym (in celo ne{que} in t{er}ra. Ioh̄. xvijo. et in c. cū martha de ce missa{rum} extra de {con}se. dist. ij. c. ī xp̄o xxxv. q. x. c. io.) ¶ And that his proclamacōn sholde be more of auctoryte to be accept / the fad{er} of heuen sent his oonly begoten sone ye seconde persone of the trynyte to make thyse proclamacōns / & mantylde ye godheed in our nature & becam man in euery con∣dycōn as we are except synne. And with a plenarye commyssyon geuen to hym all power in heuen & in erthe / as is noted (Math̄ vltīo. et Io. ij.

Saxtā. et de pe. dist. ī. c. libent{er}. et de pur. post {per}tū. c. vnico) ¶ And the seconde persone of the try¦nyte of a congruence was sente on this message to be the sone of man / ryght as he was in the trynyte the sone of the fader / as is noted / by the mayster of the Sentence. His natyuyte was proclamed by angelles at Bedleem the nyghte of his byrthe /

as is red (Luc. ijo. Ecce em̄ euangeliso vobis gau∣diū magnū. qd exit ōni populo. et de con. dist. i. noc¦te) And that more credence sholde be geuen / yt god had taken our nature / an hoste of angelles appyred & songe Gloria in excelsis deo. et in t{er}ra pax hoi{bus} bone voluntatis) And sayd to the shepeherdes that they sholde goo to Bedlem / and there they sholde (inuenire infantē iacentē in presepe et inuolutū pā¦nis) So frendes ryght as a man hauynge his gar¦mentes vpon hym / ye may not se his propre naked body. Ryght so Cryste heynge here in erthe mortal (quo ad humanitatē) his godhede was not seen / but the humanyte was the Instrument & garment therof (Quia deū nemo vidit vn{quam}) as is wryten Ioh̄. ijo. et in. c. Moyses. viij. q. i. in glo) ¶ The fad{er} also preued / that he was his one geten sone / & that he had cōmyssyon in heuen / in erth / & vpon all crea¦tures / as is wryten Math̄. xvijo. et. ij. q. vij. Item obi∣cit{ur}) And as it proued in his transfyguracyon / for out of helle he called Moyses / & out of paradyse ye prophete Hely / & the fader appyred (in voce) sayen¦ge. Hic est fili{us} me{us} dilect{us}. in quo michi bn̄ {con}pla∣cui. ip̄m audite. xciij. dist. legim{us}. et de con. dist. iij. c. fi) & so our maker & fader almyghty god wol & cō¦maūdeth / yt we shal here hym / accept hym / take hȳ for his one geten sone / & by hȳ & his worde we shal be restored to our Inherytaunce whiche man is ex∣cluded for the preuarycacōn of our fore fad{er} Adam / whiche was commaunded by the seconde persone

of the trynyte that he sholde not ete (de ligno sci∣encie boni et mali) and brake his worde & cōmaū∣dement. Ryght so now by the cōmaūdement of the sayd seconde persone god & man / by his worde and proclamacōn shal be saued & restored to theyr olde Inherytaūce / who so woll byleue in hym & obserue his worde as is wryten Ioh̄. iiijo.

And ye vn¦derstonde yt none may forgeue synne but almyghty god. And that I am god & man / & haue power of body & soule it is redde (Math̄. ix. et de pe. dist. iij. ss. {pro}ducto{rum}. et de pe. dist. i. ss. deni{que}) that the Iewes brought a man before me whiche had the Palsey in euery parte of his body. I seeyng theyr deuocyon & fayth sayd to the seke man (Confide fili remittū¦tur tibi peccata tua) The Scribes & Pharysees be∣yng present whan I forgaue hȳ his sȳnes / thought that I toke vpon me that whiche was the offyce of god & not man / & sayd (Hic blasphemat) I vnder¦stondynge ther frowarde hertes sayd vnto them. Whether it is lesse dyffyculte to forgeue synne / or to byd this man lyenge shakynge here in his bedde to ryse & go. And that ye shal se that I god & man haue power in erthe to forgeue synne.

This man was heelyd in euery parte of his body Incontynenty & without ony tracte of tyme / whiche passyd all naturall power of man / & dyde as Cryste cōmaūded hym. The water knewe that
