1 Paul the seruaunt of God and an Apostle of Iesu Christ to preache the fayth of goddis electe and ye knowledge of that trueth which is after godlynes
2 vpon the hope of eternall lyfe which lyfe God that cannot lye hath promised before the worlde begane:
3 but hath opened his worde at ye tyme apoynted thorow preachynge which preachynge is committed vnto me by the commaundement of god oure saveoure.
4 To Titus his naturall sonne in the commen fayth.Grace mercie and peace from God the father and from the lord Iesu Christ oure saveoure.
5 For this cause left I ye in Creta that thou shuldest performe that which was lackynge and shuldest ordeyne elders in every citie as I apoynted the.
6 Yf eny be fautelesse the husbande of one wyfe havynge faythfull childre which are not selandred of royote nether are disobediet.
7 For a bisshoppe must be fautelesse as it be commeth the minister of God: not stubborne not angrye no dronkarde no fyghter not geven to filthy lucre:
8 but herberous one that loveth goodnes sobre mynded righteous holy temperat
9 and suche as cleveth vnto the true worde of doctryne that he maye be able to exhorte with wholsom learnynge and to improve them that saye agaynst it.
10 For ther are many disobedient and talkers of vanite and disceavers of myndes namely they of the circumcisio
11 whose mouthes must be stopped which pervert whole houses teachinge thinges which they ought not because of filthy lucre.
12 One beynge of the selves which was a poyet of their awne sayde: The Cretayns are all wayes lyars evyll beastes and slowe belies.
13 This witnes is true wherfore rebuke them sharply that they maye be sounde in the fayth
14 and not takynge hede to Iewes fables and commaudmentes of men that turne from the trueth.
15 Vnto the pure are all thynges pure: but vnto them that are defiled and vnbelevynge is nothynge pure: but even the very myndes and consciences of them are defiled.
16 They confesse that they knowe god: but with the dedes they denye hym and are abhominable and disobedient and vnto all good workes discommendable. 

Chapter 2
1 But speake thou that which becometh wholsome learninge.
2 That ye elder me be sober honest discrete sounde in the fayth in love and in paciece.
3 And ye elder weme lykewyse that they be in soche rayment as becommeth holynes not falce accusars not geven to moche drinkynge but teachers of honest thynges
4 to make the younge wemen sobremynded to love their husbandes to love their children
5 to be discrete chast huswyfly good and obediet vnto their awne husbandes that the worde of god be not evyll spoken of.
6 Yonge men lykwyse exhorte that they be sobre mynded.
7 Above all thynges shewe thy silfe an insample of good workes with uncorrupt doctryne with honestie and with the wholsome
8 worde which cannot be rebuked that he which withstondeth maye be a shamed havynge no thinge in you yt he maye disprayse.
9 The servautes exhorte to be obediet vnto their awne masters and to please in all thynges not answerynge agayne
10 nether be pickers but that they shewe all good faythfulnes that they maye do worshippe to ye doctryne of oure saveoure God in all thynges.
11 For the grace of god that bryngeth saluacion vnto all men hath appered
12 and teacheth vs that we shuld denye vngodlynes and wordly lustes and that we shuld live sobre mynded righteously and godly in this present worlde
13 lokinge for that blessed hope and glorious apperenge of ye myghty god and of oure savioure Iesu Christ
14 which gave him silfe for vs to redeme vs from all vnrightewesnes and to pourge vs a peculiar people vnto him silfe fervently geven vnto good workes.
15 These thinges speake and exhorte and rebuke with all commaundynge Se that no man despise the. 

Chapter 3
1 Warne the that they submitte them selves to rule and power to obey the officers that they be readie vnto all good workes
2 that they speake evyll of no ma that they be no fyghters but softe shewynge all meknes vnto all men.
3 For we oure selves also were in tymes past vnwyse disobedient deceaved in daunger to lustes and to diuers maners of volupteousnes livynge in maliciousnes and envie full of hate hatinge one another.
4 But after that the kyndnes and love of oure saveoure God to mawarde appered
5 not of ye dedes of rightewesnes which we wrought but of his mercie he saved vs by ye foutayne of the newe birth and with the renuynge of the holy goost
6 which he shed on vs aboundantly thorow Iesus Christ oure saveoure
7 that we once iustified by his grace shuld be heyres of eternall lyfe thorowe hope
8 This is a true sayinge. Of these thinges I wolde thou shuldest certifie that they which beleve God myght be diligent to go forwarde in good workes. These thinges are good and proffitable vnto me.
9 Folisshe questions and genealogies and braulinges and stryfe aboute the lawe avoyde for they are vnproffitable and superfluous.
10 A ma that is geue to heresie after the fyrst and the seconde admonicion avoyde
11 remembrynge that he that is soche is perverted and synneth even damned by his awne iudgement. 
12 When I shall sende Artemas vnto the or Tichicus be diliget to come to me vnto Nichopolis. For I have determined ther to wynter.
13 Brynge zenas ye lawear and Apollos on their iorney diligently that nothynge be lackynge vnto them.
14 And let oures olso learne to excell in good workes as farforth as nede requyreth that they be not vnfrutefull.
15 All that are with me salute the. Grete them that love vs in the fayth. Grace be with you all Amen.
