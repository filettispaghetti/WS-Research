But first I wil beate downe this gros∣se blasphemy / and I wil shewe and decla∣re that our whole fayth and all the articles of the christē religiō be cōteined in the scrip¦ture of the prophetes and apostles / so that a christen man is bownd to byleue no other thing than such things as may be proued out of that scripture.

This horrible blindnes of men / and the boldnes & malycyos obstinacy which foloweth therup on (wherthorow thei blas∣pheme god and his holy word / ) is rather to be lamented than to be conuict with many reasons the thing being so manifest. But the nerer that the brightnes of the sonne of reightwisnes doth cōe / and the more clere∣ly that the light of the gospel doth shyne / so
Page  [unnumbered]
moch more blinder and more obstynate are the vnfaithful made / in so moch veryly that thei are more blynder now in the gret light than thei were before and thei stom∣ble in very dede vp on the stomblyng stone and vp on the rock of sclander. For the false teachers euen whan thei were in the most blind darknes were neuer so bold nor impu∣dent as to breake out in to such a blasphe∣my as to say the church might make ne∣we articles of the faith not cōteyned in the scripture / or that it hath auctorite to dispē∣se with the .x. cōmandmēts and to alter the forme of baptyme. Gerson / duns / dorbel / Decam / Tomas / Bonauēture / do plain∣ly condemne this heresy / and thei affirme that the truth reueled of god and conteined in the body of the bible or in the holy scrip∣ture / is the foundacion of our faith / that is to say the thīg where vp ō our fayth ought to be bylded / & thei wold neuer haue byle∣ued that there shuld euer be so gret blind¦nes in the church that any man shuld be so
Page  [unnumbered]
bold as to affirme that the articles of the christen faith ought to be sought not in the scripture but in the gloses of men and in bisshops lawes / or that mans tradicions / ri¦tes and ceremonys receyued in the church and not conteyned in the scripture / ought to be called the word of god vnwritton.

But I wil cease my cōplayning seing I know that now is the latter tyme wherof the prophetes / christ / and the apostles did prophecy that there shuld come false pro∣phetes which shuld face out the gospel and imagyne a newe gospel euen stynking / he∣thenyssh / old wiuyssh and capcyos fables inuented by the suttyl wit of man as peter and paul calle them / and of these false pro∣phetes (that is to say Antichrist) did daniel christ and paul admonissh us that he shuld extolle him self a boue god and shuld robbe god of his name / pour / wisdom / and mercy and shuld accuse him of right wisnes / cru∣elnes and weakenes & vnabylyte / which thing we do manifestly see in maner in all

their doctrynes / as in their pardons / in the popes your / in purgatory / in pryuate mas∣ses / in the prayng vnto saintes / in worshi∣pyng of Images / in the vowes of monkes and pristes / and in all mans tradicyons. And I pray yow is not this to accuse god of ignorance / of malice and of sluggissh∣nes & neclygence / to say that god hath not writton in his holy bokes of scripture all things necessary vnto our saluacyon? as though either he did not remember althin∣gs whan he gaue the scripture to be writ∣ton / or els that he could not tell all things or els that he hidde certē things from us of purpose that so he myght damne and dest∣roy us where as he had sayd before euident¦ly that we shuld be iudged at the latter day by the word which he had spoken vnto us. But thei be so blynded by the deuel that thei can not perceyue the abhominacion of this blasphemy.

Page  [unnumbered]
Now to confirme all godly myndes / and to call them back from their dotyng I haue gathered in order certen testimonys which do euidently proue that the wrytton word of god is the fowndacion of our chri∣sten fayth and that all the articles of our christen fayth ought to be prouyd by the ho¦ly scriptures.

The first is in the .iiij. of Deuterono•¦ye shal not adde vnto the worde which I speake vnto yow neyther mynissh from it. And who dyd euer expownd this to be vn∣derstand of the vnwritton word before thes lying false prophetys and antichrystes? And if it ought to be vnderstōd of the writ¦ton scripture only / than do thei playnly a∣gaynst gods word which Imagyne that there shuld be any vnwritton word. But I am not ignorant how these mockers are wont to iest or scoff a way and to face owt this place / sayng that there is one kynd of adding which minyssheth / a nother which altereth / a nother which maketh largyer
Page  [unnumbered]
and a nother which fulfilleth / & thei gra∣nt that this sayng refuseth all maner of addings sauyng the last maner / wherby the scripture is made more manifest and open. But to cōfute this fansy & Imagi∣nacyon the manifest scripture is suffycyēt deute. the .vj. what I command that shalt thow do only vnto the lord / thou shalt ney∣ther adde nor minyssh any thing. And in the last chapt. of the Apoca. Who so euer addeth any thing vnto this / the lord shal sēd hym the plages which be writō in this boke / which place all the duns men euen duns him self granteth that it ought to be vnderstond of the whole scripture. wherfo∣re it is manifest that those synne against the commandment of god which affirme that there is any word of god vnwriton / li∣ke as thei do which expownd the scripture after their own fansis or gyue iudgement of the wil of god with owt the manifest word of god. For it is a deuillyssh lye to say that the scripture can not be vnderstond
Page  [unnumbered]
with owt mens commētarys or glosys / be∣cause it is so darke & dowtful that it may be applyed to cōfirme all maner of heresys. In the .xxviij. of deuter. are proffred bene∣dyccyons of all sortys vnto them that kepe those things which are writton in the boke of the lawe. And in the .xxxij. chap. of the same boke Moyses doth manifestly say thus: Set and fyxe your hartes vpō all the wordes which I testyfye vnto you this day / that ye may command your childern to kepe and obserue all things which are writton in the boke of this lawe: for thei be not geuen and commanded vnto yow in vayne: but that euery one of you should ly∣ue after them. Marke / here is euerlasting life promysed vnto them which kepe those things that are writton in the scripture. And Moyses doth playnly say that this is the fynal and only cause why god wold ha¦ue his word to be writton / that all men in general and euery one in s•eciall of what order / degre or occupacyon so euer he be /
Page  [unnumbered]
shuld haue the word of god where by thei might be saued. wherupō it foloweth that it is a manifest blasphemy to say that we may be saued or damned by any tradicyōs of man. And here thei are conuyct to be starck idyotes which asscrybe this ignorā∣ce & neclygence vnto god / as though he ei∣ther could not or els wold not cōmyt all ar∣ticles necessary vnto our saluacyon to be writton in the holy scripture. For thei de∣clare euydently that thei knowe not the fi∣nal cause why the scripture is geuen vnto us / but thei Imagyne god to be lyke some ignorant poete which hath geuen us a pat∣ched and an vnperfight worke. For god wo∣ld that in the scripture / his will shuld shy∣ne as it were in a glasse / and that the perfi∣ght image of hys deyte (which paule cal∣leth the prynt and seale of his substance) shuld appeare therin. Item. s. Iohn sayth that this word doth shyne in darknes / and that it is the lyght which shineth in mens hartes blynded of the deuyl thorow sinne:
Page  [unnumbered]
and that christ doth open vnto us the wil of god thorow his gospel / which will no mor∣tal man did euer knowe / but so farre as this word which is in the fathers bosom / dyd open vnto him. Wherfor we may percey∣ue that it is not only thorow the ignorance of man that the word of god is thus blas∣phemed / but thorow the malyce of the de∣uyl. For the deuel neuer ceaseth to disfigure this word / namely the son of god whom he despysed before the world was made / and shal fight with him euen with all his pour vntyl the day of iudgement.

In the .xvij. of deute. The king is cō∣manded to haue alweys in his handes and in his sight / the boke of the lawe / and to re∣ade owt of it all the dayes of his life / for this purpose that he shuld lerne to feare his lord god. And for his study & diligēce this promes is made him / that he shuld lyue lōg and that his kingdome shuld be geuen to many of his progeny & lynage. And wold to god all christen kinges and princes wold
Page  [unnumbered]
think surely the reading of the holy bokes of scripture to be a part off their offyce, not to reade them in latē which thei vnder∣stand not / but so to reade it as thei may ler∣ne the wil of god / how he wil be feared by his word only / and not by any popish law∣es and mans tradicyons. And if thei wo∣ld do thus I durst surely warāt them both that thei shuld lyue longer / and also that thei shuld haue lesse tumult and sedicyon in their life tyme. For now seing thei play the tyrānes ouer the scripture and ouer the readers of it / it is no meruel that god doth ponissh them for their cruelnes / and that there be fewe of them but that dye some shameful and cruel death / for such is the end of tirannes wont to be. Ioachim king of Iuda sawe all his sonnes headed and he him self (his eyes before put out) was bownd and led presoner in to babylon / and it was sayd openly vnto him because thow hast brent the boke of Iheremy there shal be none left of thy sede which shal sit vpon
Page  [unnumbered]
the throne of dauid / and thy cark as shal be cast out in to the heate in the day time / and in to the frost in the night tyme.

Antiochus which cōmanded the holy bokes of scripture to be burnt perisshed mi∣serably in desperacyon and thorow a mer∣uelos falle. Both daniel and paul do testi∣fye that he was the figure of the last Anti¦christ that euer shuld be. Wherfor I wil not spend my wordes in vayne vnto these most damnable Antichristes / but I wryte only for the cōfort of the faithful / and for them which sinne thorow ignorance / if it shal please god to put in to their hartes to knowlege the veryte and to repent and co∣me out of the deuyls snare at whose wil and pleasure thei are now led captyue pry∣soners. And because it were a long work to serch all the aucthorytes thorowt the scrip∣ture / I wyl alledge but one place more out of the lawe / and then wil I come to the pro¦phetes and to the gospel. In the .xxx. of deu¦tero. it is writton thus / The cōmandment
Page  [unnumbered]
which I gyue vnto the is not aboue thy po∣ur neyther is it farre from the / it is not set in heauē that thou canst laufully say / whi¦ch of us all can clyme vp in to heauen to bryng it down vnto us that we may heare what it is and fulfyll it: Neyther is it set beyond the see / that thou canst laufully say which of us all is able to swymme ouer the see and to fetch it vnto us that we may he∣are what it is and fulfill that which is cō∣manded vnto us therin. But the word is nygh yea & very nygh vnto the in thy mo¦uth and in thy hart.

These wordes be spoken vnto the glo∣tēs and belly goddes of this last tyme / whi∣ch for all the gret pretēce and outward she∣we that thei make of holines / and say that thei murder men for the preseruacyō of the true fayth and of the autorycte of the chu∣rch / yet thei declare euydently inough that thei denye the vertu of holinesse seing thei be spotted and shamefully defiled with blo∣de / murder / whordome / disceyte / and with
Page  [unnumbered]
all kyndes of filthinesse and of wickednesse so that it may manyfestly appeare that thei be fully persuaded that god taketh no care at all for mankynde / yea that there is no god at all which will ponish these abho∣mynacyons? Leo the .x. called a cowncel to determine whether the soule of man were īmortal or no / and whan he had heard eue∣ry mans sentence and mynd he sayd that the matter was more diffycult than that he could determine or iudge which part had strongar reasons for it / but whether the so∣ule were mortal or īmortal / he said he wo∣ld not defraude his sowle of the cōmodytes delycyosnes and pleasures which were pre∣sent / and if there were any life after this / he wold be contēt to make good chere with other there also if he shuld see that thei wo∣ld be as good felows there as thei were here This was the voyce of the high and supre∣me bisshop / after whose sentence all men must determine of the word of god / and vp on whose arbytermēt our fayth and salua¦cyon
Page  [unnumbered]
must depend / This I say / is the iud∣gement of the holy see wherunto men must sayle out of Aphryca / Asya / and europe / Denmarke / Inglād and Irland and out of all other landes euen in to Italy vnto this vicar of christ and vnto his .xij. Car∣nals the postys of the church / which succe∣ded the apostels / to these must thei come to aske councel of the wil of god / & of the vn∣derstonding of the scripture which in their owne nacyons and in the councels of their own contrys thei can in nowyse vnderstād But moyses drawyth us from this deueli∣ssh sentence where as he sayth. The word is very nygh vnto the / euen in thy mouth and in thy hart & before thy eyes / marke / sayth he / & remember that I haue set it be¦fore thy eyes that thou maist reade in that boke yea and vnderstond it also. For els in dede it had bene but a very madnes to ha∣ue writtō such thīgs as no man could vn∣derstond. It had bene moch more worship for god to haue wryton nothing at all than
Page  [unnumbered]
so to haue mocked man kynd / where as he sayd he had set before hym good and euyl / life and death / blessyng and curse etc.

He ment not good and euel after the mea∣ning of the serpent persuading Adam that he thorow trangressyon of gods command∣mēt in eating of the forbiddyn frute / that he shuld haue the knoulege of good and euel that is euerlasting dānacyon. for so ment the deuel.

But god wil not be honored after the doctrine of the serpent / nor after the doctry∣ne of the deuel nor yet he wil not be feared after the cōmandmētes / tradiciōs and doc∣trines of men cōtrary to his word / or other wise than his word appoynteth. He for∣biddeth all maner of honor and condēnyth all maner of worship and seruyce done vn∣to him / which he hath not ordeyned or com¦māded. For these things must be lerned out of the word of god / and the wil of god both what pleaseth him and what pleaseth him noti / • known only by the holy writtō scri∣pture.

And if we byleue not this / euen hea¦uen and erth at the latter day / shal witnes against us that we folow & obey the ser∣pent (which / is now waxen a gret Anti∣christ) euen wetyngly of a sett purpose and obstynacy contrary to the exhortatiō and monicion of Moyses. For he saith / I take and call to witnes heauen and erth that I haue set before the in thy sight / life & de∣ath / blessing & curse (not that curse that the puppy bloweth out vnder the name of almighty god & the holy saintes Peter & Paul) but euen this curse which / if we re∣gard or obey the pope / we shal heare of ch∣rist go your way ye cursed in to euerlasting fire which is prepared for the deuel & his messengers. For christ geueth us warning there / as Moises did / of the belly goddes of the last time / of the fals lying prophe∣tes & of the fals christes which shuld ima∣gyne a newe word and a newe Christ bo∣wnd to certen appointed places dayes / me∣ates / othes / vowes & bandes to absteyne
