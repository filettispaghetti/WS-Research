Psalms 104:2	Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:
Psalms 104:3	Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:
Psalms 104:4	Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:
Psalms 104:5	Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.
