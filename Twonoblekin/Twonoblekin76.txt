To spy advantages, and where he finds 'em,
He's swift to make 'em his. He does no wrongs,
Nor takes none. He's round-faced, and when he
smiles
He shows a lover; when he frowns, a soldier.
About his head he wears the winner's oak,
And in it stuck the favor of his lady.
His age some six-and-thirty. In his hand
He bears a charging-staff embossed with silver.

THESEUS
Are they all thus?

PIRITHOUS  They are all the sons of honor.

THESEUS
Now, as I have a soul, I long to see 'em.--
Lady, you shall see men fight now.

HIPPOLYTA  I wish it,
But not the cause, my lord. They would show
Bravely about the titles of two kingdoms;
'Tis pity love should be so tyrannous.--
O, my soft-hearted sister, what think you?
Weep not till they weep blood. Wench, it must be.

THESEUS, [to Emilia]
You have steeled 'em with your beauty. [(To
Pirithous.)] Honored friend,
To you I give the field; pray order it
Fitting the persons that must use it.

PIRITHOUS  Yes, sir.

THESEUS
Come, I'll go visit 'em. I cannot stay--
Their fame has fired me so--till they appear.
Good friend, be royal.

PIRITHOUS  There shall want no bravery.
[All but Emilia exit.]

EMILIA
Poor wench, go weep, for whosoever wins
Loses a noble cousin for thy sins.
[She exits.]
