PALAMON  Well, sir, I'll pledge you.
[He drinks.]

ARCITE
Drink a good hearty draught; it breeds good blood,
man.
Do not you feel it thaw you?

PALAMON  Stay, I'll tell you
After a draught or two more.

ARCITE  Spare it not.
The Duke has more, coz. Eat now.

PALAMON  Yes.	[He eats.]

ARCITE  I am glad
You have so good a stomach.

PALAMON  I am gladder
I have so good meat to 't.

ARCITE  Is 't not mad lodging
Here in the wild woods, cousin?

PALAMON  Yes, for them
That have wild consciences.

ARCITE  How tastes your
victuals?
Your hunger needs no sauce, I see.

PALAMON  Not much.
But if it did, yours is too tart, sweet cousin.
What is this?

ARCITE  Venison.

PALAMON  'Tis a lusty meat.
Give me more wine. Here, Arcite, to the wenches
We have known in our days!
[He raises his cup in a toast.]
The Lord Steward's
daughter!
Do you remember her?

ARCITE  After you, coz.

PALAMON
She loved a black-haired man.
