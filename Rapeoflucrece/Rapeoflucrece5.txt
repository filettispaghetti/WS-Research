
This silent war of lilies and of roses,
Which Tarquin viewed in her fair face's field,
In their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses,
Where, lest between them both it should be killed,
The coward captive vanquished doth yield
  To those two armies that would let him go
  Rather than triumph in so false a foe.

Now thinks he that her husband's shallow tongue,
The niggard prodigal that praised her so,
In that high task hath done her beauty wrong,
Which far exceeds his barren skill to show.
Therefore that praise which Collatine doth owe
  Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
  In silent wonder of still-gazing eyes.

This earthly saint, adored by this devil,
Little suspecteth the false worshiper,
For unstained thoughts do seldom dream on evil;
Birds never limed no secret bushes fear.
So, guiltless, she securely gives good cheer
  And reverend welcome to her princely guest,
  Whose inward ill no outward harm expressed.

For that he colored with his high estate,
Hiding base sin in pleats of majesty,
That nothing in him seemed inordinate,
Save sometimes too much wonder of his eye,
Which, having all, all could not satisfy,
  But, poorly rich, so wanteth in his store
  That, cloyed with much, he pineth still for more.

But she, that never coped with stranger eyes,
Could pick no meaning from their parling looks
Nor read the subtle shining secrecies
Writ in the glassy margents of such books.
She touched no unknown baits nor feared no hooks,
  Nor could she moralize his wanton sight
  More than his eyes were opened to the light.

He stories to her ears her husband's fame,
Won in the fields of fruitful Italy,
And decks with praises Collatine's high name,
Made glorious by his manly chivalry
With bruised arms and wreaths of victory.
  Her joy with heaved-up hand she doth express
  And, wordless, so greets heaven for his success.

Far from the purpose of his coming thither
