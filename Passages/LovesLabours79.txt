DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat
in my shirt.
DUMAIN
You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Sweet bloods, I both may and will.
BIRON
What reason have you for't?
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
The naked truth of it is, I have no shirt; I go
woolward for penance.
BOYET
True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of
linen: since when, I'll be sworn, he wore none but
a dishclout of Jaquenetta's, and that a' wears next
his heart for a favour.
Enter MERCADE

MERCADE
God save you, madam!
PRINCESS
Welcome, Mercade;
But that thou interrupt'st our merriment.
MERCADE
I am sorry, madam; for the news I bring
Is heavy in my tongue. The king your father--
PRINCESS
Dead, for my life!
MERCADE
Even so; my tale is told.
BIRON
Worthies, away! the scene begins to cloud.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have
seen the day of wrong through the little hole of
discretion, and I will right myself like a soldier.
Exeunt Worthies

FERDINAND
How fares your majesty?
PRINCESS
Boyet, prepare; I will away tonight.
FERDINAND
Madam, not so; I do beseech you, stay.
PRINCESS
