THALIARD
My lord,
'Tis done.
ANTIOCHUS
Enough.
Enter a Messenger

Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.
Messenger
My lord, prince Pericles is fled.
Exit

ANTIOCHUS
As thou
Wilt live, fly after: and like an arrow shot
From a well-experienced archer hits the mark
His eye doth level at, so thou ne'er return
Unless thou say 'Prince Pericles is dead.'
THALIARD
My lord,
If I can get him within my pistol's length,
I'll make him sure enough: so, farewell to your highness.
ANTIOCHUS
Thaliard, adieu!
Exit THALIARD

Till Pericles be dead,
My heart can lend no succor to my head.
Exit

SCENE II. Tyre. A room in the palace.

Enter PERICLES
PERICLES
[To Lords without] Let none disturb us.--Why should
this change of thoughts,
The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,
Be my so used a guest as not an hour,
In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,
The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?
Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,
And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,
Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:
Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,
Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.
Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,
That have their first conception by mis-dread,
Have after-nourishment and life by care;
And what was first but fear what might be done,
Grows elder now and cares it be not done.
