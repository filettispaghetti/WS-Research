Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but,
at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at
the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn
down indirectly to the Jew's house.
GOBBO
By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit. Can
you tell me whether one Launcelot,
that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?
LAUNCELOT
Talk you of young Master Launcelot?
Aside

Mark me now; now will I raise the waters. Talk you
of young Master Launcelot?
GOBBO
No master, sir, but a poor man's son: his father,
though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor man
and, God be thanked, well to live.
LAUNCELOT
Well, let his father be what a' will, we talk of
young Master Launcelot.
GOBBO
Your worship's friend and Launcelot, sir.
LAUNCELOT
But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you,
talk you of young Master Launcelot?
GOBBO
Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.
LAUNCELOT
Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master
Launcelot, father; for the young gentleman,
according to Fates and Destinies and such odd
sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of
learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would say
in plain terms, gone to heaven.
GOBBO
Marry, God forbid! the boy was the very staff of my
age, my very prop.
LAUNCELOT
Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or
a prop? Do you know me, father?
GOBBO
Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman:
but, I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest his
soul, alive or dead?
LAUNCELOT
Do you not know me, father?
GOBBO
Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.
LAUNCELOT
