Worthy voices!
Re-enter MENENIUS, with BRUTUS and SICINIUS

MENENIUS
You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes
Endue you with the people's voice: remains
That, in the official marks invested, you
Anon do meet the senate.
CORIOLANUS
Is this done?
SICINIUS
The custom of request you have discharged:
The people do admit you, and are summon'd
To meet anon, upon your approbation.
CORIOLANUS
Where? at the senate-house?
SICINIUS
There, Coriolanus.
CORIOLANUS
May I change these garments?
SICINIUS
You may, sir.
CORIOLANUS
That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,
Repair to the senate-house.
MENENIUS
I'll keep you company. Will you along?
BRUTUS
We stay here for the people.
SICINIUS
Fare you well.
Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS

He has it now, and by his looks methink
'Tis warm at 's heart.
