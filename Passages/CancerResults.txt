In the case of metastatic breast cancer, 76% of CTCA patients who 
were diagnosed between 2000 and 2011 and/or at least initially 
partly treated at our hospitals survived 1.5 years after the 
initial diagnosis, while 55% of the SEER metastatic breast cancer
 patients survived for at least that long.
