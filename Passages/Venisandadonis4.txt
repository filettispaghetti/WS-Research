  What follows more she murders with a kiss.

Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,
Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh, and bone,
Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste
Till either gorge be stuffed or prey be gone,
  Even so she kissed his brow, his cheek, his chin,
  And where she ends she doth anew begin.

Forced to content but never to obey,
Panting he lies and breatheth in her face.
She feedeth on the steam as on a prey
And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace,
  Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers,
  So they were dewed with such distilling showers.

Look how a bird lies tangled in a net,
So fastened in her arms Adonis lies.
Pure shame and awed resistance made him fret,
Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes.
  Rain added to a river that is rank
  Perforce will force it overflow the bank.

Still she entreats, and prettily entreats,
For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale.
Still is he sullen, still he lours and frets,
'Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy pale;
  Being red, she loves him best, and being white,
  Her best is bettered with a more delight.

Look how he can, she cannot choose but love,
And by her fair immortal hand she swears
From his soft bosom never to remove
Till he take truce with her contending tears,
  Which long have rained, making her cheeks all wet,
  And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt.

Upon this promise did he raise his chin
Like a divedapper peering through a wave,
Who, being looked on, ducks as quickly in;
So offers he to give what she did crave,
  But when her lips were ready for his pay,
  He winks and turns his lips another way.

Never did passenger in summer's heat
More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.
Her help she sees, but help she cannot get;
She bathes in water, yet her fire must burn.
  "O, pity," gan she cry, "flint-hearted boy!
  'Tis but a kiss I beg. Why art thou coy?
