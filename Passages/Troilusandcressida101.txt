Enter AGAMEMNON, AJAX, MENELAUS, NESTOR, DIOMEDES, and others, marching. Shouts within
AGAMEMNON
Hark! hark! what shout is that?
NESTOR
Peace, drums!
Within

Achilles! Achilles! Hector's slain! Achilles.
DIOMEDES
The bruit is, Hector's slain, and by Achilles.
AJAX
If it be so, yet bragless let it be;
Great Hector was a man as good as he.
AGAMEMNON
March patiently along: let one be sent
To pray Achilles see us at our tent.
If in his death the gods have us befriended,
Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.
Exeunt, marching

SCENE X. Another part of the plains.

Enter TROILUS

TROILUS
Hector is slain.

TROILUS
He's dead; and at the murderer's horse's tail,
In beastly sort, dragg'd through the shameful field.
Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed!
Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!
I say, at once let your brief plagues be mercy,
And linger not our sure destructions on!
AENEAS
My lord, you do discomfort all the host!
TROILUS
You understand me not that tell me so:
I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,
But dare all imminence that gods and men
Address their dangers in. Hector is gone:
Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?
Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd,
Go in to Troy, and say there, Hector's dead:
