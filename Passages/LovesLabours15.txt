I will visit thee at the lodge.
JAQUENETTA
That's hereby.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
I know where it is situate.
JAQUENETTA
Lord, how wise you are!
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
I will tell thee wonders.
JAQUENETTA
With that face?
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
I love thee.
JAQUENETTA
So I heard you say.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
And so, farewell.
JAQUENETTA
Fair weather after you!
DULL
Come, Jaquenetta, away!
Exeunt DULL and JAQUENETTA

DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou
be pardoned.
COSTARD
Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a
full stomach.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Thou shalt be heavily punished.
COSTARD
I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they
are but lightly rewarded.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Take away this villain; shut him up.
MOTH
Come, you transgressing slave; away!
COSTARD
Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.
MOTH
No, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison.
COSTARD
