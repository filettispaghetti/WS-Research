And punish them to your height of pleasure.
Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
Though they would swear down each particular saint,
Were testimonies against his worth and credit
That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
There is another friar that set them on;
Let him be sent for.
FRIAR PETER
Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed
Hath set the women on to this complaint:
Your provost knows the place where he abides
And he may fetch him.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Go do it instantly.
Exit Provost

And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
Do with your injuries as seems you best,
In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;
But stir not you till you have well determined
Upon these slanderers.
ESCALUS
My lord, we'll do it throughly.
Exit DUKE

Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that
Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?
LUCIO
'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing
but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most
villanous speeches of the duke.
ESCALUS
We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a
notable fellow.
LUCIO
As any in Vienna, on my word.
ESCALUS
Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.
Exit an Attendant

Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you
shall see how I'll handle her.
LUCIO
Not better than he, by her own report.
ESCALUS
