Second Lord
[Aside] You are cock and capon too; and you crow,
cock, with your comb on.
CLOTEN
Sayest thou?
Second Lord
It is not fit your lordship should undertake every
companion that you give offence to.
CLOTEN

offence to my inferiors.
Second Lord

First Lord
Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?
CLOTEN
A stranger, and I not know on't!
Second Lord
[Aside] He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it
not.
First Lord
There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought, one of
Leonatus' friends.

First Lord

Second Lord
I'll attend your lordship.
