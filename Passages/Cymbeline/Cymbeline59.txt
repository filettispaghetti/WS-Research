ARVIRAGUS
I'll make't my comfort
He is a man; I'll love him as my brother:
And such a welcome as I'd give to him
After long absence, such is yours: most welcome!
Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends.
IMOGEN
'Mongst friends,
If brothers.
Aside

Would it had been so, that they
Had been my father's sons! then had my prize
Been less, and so more equal ballasting
To thee, Posthumus.
BELARIUS
He wrings at some distress.
GUIDERIUS
Would I could free't!
ARVIRAGUS
Or I, whate'er it be,
What pain it cost, what danger. God's!
BELARIUS
Hark, boys.
Whispering

IMOGEN
Great men,
That had a court no bigger than this cave,
That did attend themselves and had the virtue
Which their own conscience seal'd them--laying by
That nothing-gift of differing multitudes--
Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!
I'd change my sex to be companion with them,
Since Leonatus's false.
BELARIUS
It shall be so.
Boys, we'll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in:
Discourse is heavy, fasting; when we have supp'd,
We'll mannerly demand thee of thy story,
So far as thou wilt speak it.
GUIDERIUS
Pray, draw near.
ARVIRAGUS
The night to the owl and morn to the lark
less welcome.
IMOGEN
Thanks, sir.
ARVIRAGUS
I pray, draw near.
