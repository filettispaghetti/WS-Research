Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour
He will remain so.
PISANIO
I humbly thank your highness.
QUEEN
Pray, walk awhile.
IMOGEN
About some half-hour hence,
I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least
Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.
Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. A public place.

Enter CLOTEN and two Lords
First Lord
Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the
violence of action hath made you reek as a
sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:
there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.
CLOTEN
If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?
Second Lord
[Aside] No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.
First Lord
Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be
not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.
Second Lord
[Aside] His steel was in debt; it went o' the
backside the town.
CLOTEN
The villain would not stand me.
Second Lord
[Aside] No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.
First Lord
Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but
he added to your having; gave you some ground.
Second Lord
[Aside] As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!
CLOTEN
I would they had not come between us.
Second Lord
[Aside] So would I, till you had measured how long
a fool you were upon the ground.
CLOTEN
And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!
Second Lord
[Aside] If it be a sin to make a true election, she
is damned.
First Lord
