IACHIMO
Your lady
Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
And therewithal the best; or let her beauty
Look through a casement to allure false hearts
And be false with them.
IACHIMO
Here are letters for you.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
Their tenor good, I trust.
IACHIMO
'Tis very like.
PHILARIO
Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
When you were there?
IACHIMO
He was expected then,
But not approach'd.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
All is well yet.
Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is't not
Too dull for your good wearing?
IACHIMO
If I had lost it,
I should have lost the worth of it in gold.
I'll make a journey twice as far, to enjoy
A second night of such sweet shortness which
Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
The stone's too hard to come by.
IACHIMO
Not a whit,
Your lady being so easy.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
Make not, sir,
Your loss your sport: I hope you know that we
Must not continue friends.
IACHIMO
Good sir, we must,
If you keep covenant. Had I not brought
The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant
We were to question further: but I now
Profess myself the winner of her honour,
Together with your ring; and not the wronger
Of her or you, having proceeded but
By both your wills.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
If you can make't apparent
That you have tasted her in bed, my hand
