Render to me some corporal sign about her,
More evident than this; for this was stolen.
IACHIMO
By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.
'Tis true:--nay, keep the ring--'tis true: I am sure
She would not lose it: her attendants are
All sworn and honourable:--they induced to steal it!
And by a stranger!--No, he hath enjoyed her:
The cognizance of her incontinency
Is this: she hath bought the name of whore
thus dearly.
There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell
Divide themselves between you!
PHILARIO
Sir, be patient:
This is not strong enough to be believed
Of one persuaded well of--
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
Never talk on't;
She hath been colted by him.
IACHIMO
If you seek
For further satisfying, under her breast--
Worthy the pressing--lies a mole, right proud
Of that most delicate lodging: by my life,
I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hunger
To feed again, though full. You do remember
This stain upon her?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
Ay, and it doth confirm
Another stain, as big as hell can hold,
Were there no more but it.
IACHIMO
Will you hear more?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns;
Once, and a million!
IACHIMO
I'll be sworn--
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
No swearing.
If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;
And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny
Thou'st made me cuckold.
IACHIMO
I'll deny nothing.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!
