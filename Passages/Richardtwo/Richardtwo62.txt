To whose high will we bound our calm contents.
To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,
Whose state and honour I for aye allow.
DUCHESS OF YORK
Here comes my son Aumerle.
DUKE OF YORK
Aumerle that was;
But that is lost for being Richard's friend,
And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:
I am in parliament pledge for his truth
And lasting fealty to the new-made king.
Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE

DUCHESS OF YORK
Welcome, my son: who are the violets now
That strew the green lap of the new come spring?
DUKE OF AUMERLE
Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:
God knows I had as lief be none as one.
DUKE OF YORK
Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,
Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.
What news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?
DUKE OF AUMERLE
For aught I know, my lord, they do.
DUKE OF YORK
You will be there, I know.
DUKE OF AUMERLE
If God prevent not, I purpose so.
DUKE OF YORK
What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?
Yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing.
DUKE OF AUMERLE
My lord, 'tis nothing.
DUKE OF YORK
No matter, then, who see it;
I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.
DUKE OF AUMERLE
I do beseech your grace to pardon me:
It is a matter of small consequence,
Which for some reasons I would not have seen.
DUKE OF YORK
Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.
I fear, I fear,--
DUCHESS OF YORK
What should you fear?
'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into
For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.
DUKE OF YORK
Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond
