Enter KING RICHARD and his attendants below

HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Stand all apart,
And show fair duty to his majesty.
He kneels down

My gracious lord,--
KING RICHARD II
Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee
To make the base earth proud with kissing it:
Me rather had my heart might feel your love
Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.
Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,
Thus high at least, although your knee be low.
HENRY BOLINGBROKE
My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.
KING RICHARD II
Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.
HENRY BOLINGBROKE
So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,
As my true service shall deserve your love.
KING RICHARD II
Well you deserve: they well deserve to have,
That know the strong'st and surest way to get.
Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;
Tears show their love, but want their remedies.
Cousin, I am too young to be your father,
Though you are old enough to be my heir.
What you will have, I'll give, and willing too;
For do we must what force will have us do.
Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?
HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Yea, my good lord.
KING RICHARD II
Then I must not say no.
Flourish. Exeunt

SCENE IV. LANGLEY. The DUKE OF YORK's garden.

Enter the QUEEN and two Ladies
QUEEN
What sport shall we devise here in this garden,
To drive away the heavy thought of care?
Lady
Madam, we'll play at bowls.
QUEEN
'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,
And that my fortune rubs against the bias.
Lady
