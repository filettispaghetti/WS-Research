because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I
am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out
of the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow and
sigh till he come.
CELIA
And I'll sleep.
Exeunt

Forester

SONG.
Forester
What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
His leather skin and horns to wear.
Then sing him home;
