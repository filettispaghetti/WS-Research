Exeunt

Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH, with SIR ANDREW

SIR TOBY BELCH
Why, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such a
firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and
all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal
motion, that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he
pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they
step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.
SIR ANDREW
Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.
SIR TOBY BELCH
Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can
scarce hold him yonder.
SIR ANDREW
Plague on't, an I thought he had been valiant and so
cunning in fence, I'ld have seen him damned ere I'ld
have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip,
and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet.
SIR TOBY BELCH
I'll make the motion: stand here, make a good show
on't: this shall end without the perdition of souls.
Aside

Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.
Re-enter FABIAN and VIOLA

To FABIAN

I have his horse to take up the quarrel:
I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.
FABIAN
He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and
looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.
SIR TOBY BELCH
[To VIOLA] There's no remedy, sir; he will fight
with you for's oath sake: marry, he hath better
bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now
scarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw, for
the supportance of his vow; he protests he will not hurt you.
VIOLA
[Aside] Pray God defend me! A little thing would
make me tell them how much I lack of a man.
FABIAN
Give ground, if you see him furious.
SIR TOBY BELCH
Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy; the gentleman
will, for his honour's sake, have one bout with you;
