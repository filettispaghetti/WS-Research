Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?
SEBASTIAN
Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow:
Let me be clear of thee.
Clown
Well held out, i' faith! No, I do not know you; nor
I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come
speak with her; nor your name is not Master Cesario;
nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so is so.
SEBASTIAN
I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else: Thou
know'st not me.
Clown
Vent my folly! he has heard that word of some
great man and now applies it to a fool. Vent my
folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world,
will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy
strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my
lady: shall I vent to her that thou art coming?
SEBASTIAN
I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me: There's
money for thee: if you tarry longer, I shall give
worse payment.
Clown
By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men
that give fools money get themselves a good
report--after fourteen years' purchase.
Enter SIR ANDREW, SIR TOBY BELCH, and FABIAN

SIR ANDREW
Now, sir, have I met you again? there's for you.
SEBASTIAN
Why, there's for thee, and there, and there. Are all
the people mad?
SIR TOBY BELCH
Hold, sir, or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house.
Clown
This will I tell my lady straight: I would not be
in some of your coats for two pence.
Exit

SIR TOBY BELCH
Come on, sir; hold.
SIR ANDREW
Nay, let him alone: I'll go another way to work
with him; I'll have an action of battery against
him, if there be any law in Illyria: though I
struck him first, yet it's no matter for that.
SEBASTIAN
Let go thy hand.
