Basely insinuate and send us gifts.
AARON
Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?
Did you not use his daughter very friendly?
DEMETRIUS
I would we had a thousand Roman dames
At such a bay, by turn to serve our lust.
CHIRON
A charitable wish and full of love.
AARON
Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.
CHIRON
And that would she for twenty thousand more.
DEMETRIUS
Come, let us go; and pray to all the gods
For our beloved mother in her pains.
AARON
[Aside] Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.
Trumpets sound within

DEMETRIUS
Why do the emperor's trumpets flourish thus?
CHIRON
Belike, for joy the emperor hath a son.
DEMETRIUS
Soft! who comes here?
Enter a Nurse, with a blackamoor Child in her arms

Nurse
Good morr ow, lords:
O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?
AARON
Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all,
Here Aaron is; and what with Aaron now?
Nurse
O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!
Now help, or woe betide thee evermore!
AARON
Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!
What dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms?
Nurse
O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye,
Our empress' shame, and stately Rome's disgrace!
She is deliver'd, lords; she is deliver'd.
AARON
To whom?
Nurse
I mean, she is brought a-bed.
AARON
Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?
