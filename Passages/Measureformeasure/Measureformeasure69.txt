Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:
I, in probation of a sisterhood,
Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
As then the messenger,--
LUCIO
That's I, an't like your grace:
I came to her from Claudio, and desired her
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
For her poor brother's pardon.
ISABELLA
That's he indeed.
DUKE VINCENTIO
You were not bid to speak.
LUCIO
No, my good lord;
Nor wish'd to hold my peace.
DUKE VINCENTIO
I wish you now, then;
Pray you, take note of it: and when you have
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
Be perfect.
LUCIO
I warrant your honour.
DUKE VINCENTIO
The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.
ISABELLA
This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--
LUCIO
Right.
DUKE VINCENTIO
It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
To speak before your time. Proceed.
ISABELLA
I went
To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--
DUKE VINCENTIO
That's somewhat madly spoken.
ISABELLA
Pardon it;
The phrase is to the matter.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Mended again. The matter; proceed.
ISABELLA
In brief, to set the needless process by,
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--
For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion
I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
