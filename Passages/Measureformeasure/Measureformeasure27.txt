ANGELO
Why do you put these sayings upon me?
ISABELLA
Because authority, though it err like others,
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;
Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
That's like my brother's fault: if it confess
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
Against my brother's life.
ANGELO
[Aside] She speaks, and 'tis
Such sense, that my sense breeds with it. Fare you well.
ISABELLA
Gentle my lord, turn back.
ANGELO
I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.
ISABELLA
Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.
ANGELO
How! bribe me?
ISABELLA
Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.
LUCIO
[Aside to ISABELLA] You had marr'd all else.
ISABELLA
Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
As fancy values them; but with true prayers
That shall be up at heaven and enter there
Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
To nothing temporal.
ANGELO
Well; come to me to-morrow.
LUCIO
[Aside to ISABELLA] Go to; 'tis well; away!
ISABELLA
Heaven keep your honour safe!
ANGELO
[Aside]	Amen:
For I am that way going to temptation,
Where prayers cross.
ISABELLA
At what hour to-morrow
Shall I attend your lordship?
ANGELO
At any time 'fore noon.
ISABELLA
