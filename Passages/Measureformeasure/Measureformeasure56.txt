That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.
Re-enter Provost

Provost
There he must stay until the officer
Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,
But he must die to-morrow?
Provost
None, sir, none.
DUKE VINCENTIO
As near the dawning, provost, as it is,
You shall hear more ere morning.
Provost
Happily
You something know; yet I believe there comes
No countermand; no such example have we:
Besides, upon the very siege of justice
Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
Profess'd the contrary.
Enter a Messenger

This is his lordship's man.
DUKE VINCENTIO
And here comes Claudio's pardon.
Messenger
[Giving a paper]
My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this
further charge, that you swerve not from the
smallest article of it, neither in time, matter, or
other circumstance. Good morrow; for, as I take it,
it is almost day.
Provost
I shall obey him.
Exit Messenger

DUKE VINCENTIO
[Aside] This is his pardon, purchased by such sin
For which the pardoner himself is in.
Hence hath offence his quick celerity,
When it is born in high authority:
When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended,
That for the fault's love is the offender friended.
Now, sir, what news?
Provost
I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss
in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted
putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.
DUKE VINCENTIO
