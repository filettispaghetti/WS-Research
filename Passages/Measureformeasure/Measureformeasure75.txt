Say you?
LUCIO
Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,
she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,
she'll be ashamed.
ESCALUS
I will go darkly to work with her.
LUCIO
That's the way; for women are light at midnight.
Re-enter Officers with ISABELLA; and Provost with the DUKE VINCENTIO in his friar's habit

ESCALUS
Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all
that you have said.
LUCIO
My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with
the provost.
ESCALUS
In very good time: speak not you to him till we
call upon you.
LUCIO
Mum.
ESCALUS
Come, sir: did you set these women on to slander
Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.
DUKE VINCENTIO
'Tis false.
ESCALUS
How! know you where you are?
DUKE VINCENTIO
Respect to your great place! and let the devil
Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.
ESCALUS
The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:
Look you speak justly.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,
Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
And put your trial in the villain's mouth
Which here you come to accuse.
LUCIO
This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.
ESCALUS
Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,
Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth
