Go to; let that be mine:
Do you your office, or give up your place,
And you shall well be spared.
Provost
I crave your honour's pardon.
What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?
She's very near her hour.
ANGELO
Dispose of her
To some more fitter place, and that with speed.
Re-enter Servant

Servant
Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
Desires access to you.
ANGELO
Hath he a sister?
Provost
Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
If not already.
ANGELO
Well, let her be admitted.
Exit Servant

See you the fornicatress be removed:
Let have needful, but not lavish, means;
There shall be order for't.
Enter ISABELLA and LUCIO

Provost
God save your honour!
ANGELO
Stay a little while.
To ISABELLA

You're welcome: what's your will?
ISABELLA
I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
Please but your honour hear me.
ANGELO
Well; what's your suit?
ISABELLA
There is a vice that most I do abhor,
And most desire should meet the blow of justice;
For which I would not plead, but that I must;
For which I must not plead, but that I am
At war 'twixt will and will not.
ANGELO
Well; the matter?
