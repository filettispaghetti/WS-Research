What's o'clock, think you?
Justice
Eleven, sir.
ESCALUS
I pray you home to dinner with me.
Justice
I humbly thank you.
ESCALUS
It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
But there's no remedy.
Justice
Lord Angelo is severe.
ESCALUS
It is but needful:
Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;
Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:
But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.
Come, sir.
Exeunt

SCENE II. Another room in the same.

Enter Provost and a Servant
Servant
He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight
I'll tell him of you.
Provost
Pray you, do.
Exit Servant

I'll know
His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,
He hath but as offended in a dream!
All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he
To die for't!
Enter ANGELO

ANGELO
Now, what's the matter. Provost?
Provost
Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?
ANGELO
Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?
Why dost thou ask again?
Provost
Lest I might be too rash:
Under your good correction, I have seen,
When, after execution, judgment hath
Repented o'er his doom.
ANGELO
