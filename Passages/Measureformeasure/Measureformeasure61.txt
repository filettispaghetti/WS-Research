DUKE VINCENTIO
O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you
Look forward on the journey you shall go.
BARNARDINE
I swear I will not die to-day for any man's

A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
Just of his colour. What if we do omit
This reprobate till he were well inclined;
And satisfy the deputy with the visage

And how shall we continue Claudio,
To save me from the danger that might come
If he were known alive?
DUKE VINCENTIO
Let this be done.
Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:
