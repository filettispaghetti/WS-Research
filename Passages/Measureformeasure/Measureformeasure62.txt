Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
To the under generation, you shall find
Your safety manifested.
Provost
I am your free dependant.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.
Exit Provost

Now will I write letters to Angelo,--
The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents
Shall witness to him I am near at home,
And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
To enter publicly: him I'll desire
To meet me at the consecrated fount
A league below the city; and from thence,
By cold gradation and well-balanced form,
We shall proceed with Angelo.
Re-enter Provost

Provost
Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
For I would commune with you of such things
That want no ear but yours.
Provost
I'll make all speed.
Exit

ISABELLA
[Within] Peace, ho, be here!
DUKE VINCENTIO
The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:
But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
To make her heavenly comforts of despair,
When it is least expected.
Enter ISABELLA

ISABELLA
Ho, by your leave!
DUKE VINCENTIO
Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.
ISABELLA
The better, given me by so holy a man.
Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?
DUKE VINCENTIO
He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:
His head is off and sent to Angelo.
