Spoke like an officer; ha' to thee, lad!
Drinks to HORTENSIO

BAPTISTA
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
GREMIO
Believe me, sir, they butt together well.
BIANCA

VINCENTIO
Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?
BIANCA

And then pursue me as you draw your bow.

Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.

BAPTISTA

LUCENTIO

PETRUCHIO

And, as the jest did glance away from me,
'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
BAPTISTA
Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.
PETRUCHIO
Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance
