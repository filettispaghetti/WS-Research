They died in perfume. On my head no toy
But was her pattern; her affections--pretty,
Though haply hers careless were--I followed
For my most serious decking. Had mine ear
Stol'n some new air, or at adventure hummed one
From musical coinage, why, it was a note
Whereon her spirits would sojourn--rather, dwell
on--
And sing it in her slumbers. This rehearsal--
Which fury-innocent wots well comes in
Like old importment's bastard--has this end,
That the true love 'tween maid and maid may be
More than in sex individual.

HIPPOLYTA  You're out of breath,
And this high-speeded pace is but to say
That you shall never--like the maid Flavina--
Love any that's called man.

EMILIA  I am sure I shall not.

HIPPOLYTA  Now, alack, weak sister,
I must no more believe thee in this point--
Though in 't I know thou dost believe thyself--
Than I will trust a sickly appetite,
That loathes even as it longs. But sure, my sister,
If I were ripe for your persuasion, you
Have said enough to shake me from the arm
Of the all-noble Theseus, for whose fortunes
I will now in and kneel, with great assurance
That we, more than his Pirithous, possess
The high throne in his heart.

EMILIA  I am not
Against your faith, yet I continue mine.

Scene 4
=======
[Cornets. A battle struck within; then a retreat.
Flourish. Then enter, through one door, Theseus,
victor, accompanied by Lords and Soldiers.
Entering through another door, the three Queens
meet him, and fall on their faces before him.]


FIRST QUEEN
To thee no star be dark!

SECOND QUEEN  Both heaven and Earth
