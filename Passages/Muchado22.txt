DON PEDRO
Will you have me, lady?
BEATRICE
No, my lord, unless I might have another for
working-days: your grace is too costly to wear
every day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: I
was born to speak all mirth and no matter.
DON PEDRO
Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best
becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in
a merry hour.
BEATRICE
No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there
was a star danced, and under that was I born.
Cousins, God give you joy!
LEONATO
Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?
BEATRICE
I cry you mercy, uncle. By your grace's pardon.

DON PEDRO
By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.
LEONATO
There's little of the melancholy element in her, my
lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps, and
not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,
she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked
herself with laughing.
DON PEDRO
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.
LEONATO
O, by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.
DON PEDRO
She were an excellent wife for Benedict.
LEONATO
O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married,
they would talk themselves mad.
DON PEDRO
County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?
CLAUDIO
To-morrow, my lord: time goes on crutches till love
have all his rites.
LEONATO
Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just
seven-night; and a time too brief, too, to have all
things answer my mind.
DON PEDRO
Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing:
but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go
