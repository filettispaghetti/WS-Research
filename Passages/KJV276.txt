Job 34:18	Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?
Job 34:19	How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.
Job 34:20	In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
Job 34:21	For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.
Job 34:22	There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
Job 34:23	For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.
Job 34:24	He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
Job 34:25	Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
Job 34:26	He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
Job 34:27	Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:
Job 34:28	So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
Job 34:29	When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:
Job 34:30	That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
Job 34:31	Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:
Job 34:32	That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
Job 34:33	Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.
Job 34:34	Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.
Job 34:35	Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.
Job 34:36	My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.
Job 34:37	For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.
Job 35:1	Elihu spake moreover, and said,
Job 35:2	Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?
Job 35:3	For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?
Job 35:4	I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.
Job 35:5	Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.
Job 35:6	If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?
Job 35:7	If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?
Job 35:8	Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.
Job 35:9	By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
Job 35:10	But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;
Job 35:11	Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
Job 35:12	There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.
Job 35:13	Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.
Job 35:14	Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.
Job 35:15	But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:
Job 35:16	Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
Job 36:1	Elihu also proceeded, and said,
Job 36:2	Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.
Job 36:3	I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
Job 36:4	For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
Job 36:5	Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.
Job 36:6	He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.
Job 36:7	He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.
Job 36:8	And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;
Job 36:9	Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.
Job 36:10	He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.
Job 36:11	If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.
Job 36:12	But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.
Job 36:13	But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.
Job 36:14	They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.
