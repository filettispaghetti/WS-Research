DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
By heart and in heart, boy.
MOTH
And out of heart, master: all those three I will prove.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
What wilt thou prove?
MOTH
A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon
the instant: by heart you love her, because your
heart cannot come by her; in heart you love her,
because your heart is in love with her; and out of
heart you love her, being out of heart that you
cannot enjoy her.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
I am all these three.
MOTH
And three times as much more, and yet nothing at
all.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.
MOTH
A message well sympathized; a horse to be ambassador
for an ass.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Ha, ha! what sayest thou?
MOTH
Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse,
for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
The way is but short: away!
MOTH
As swift as lead, sir.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
The meaning, pretty ingenious?
Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?
MOTH
Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
I say lead is slow.
MOTH
You are too swift, sir, to say so:
Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?
