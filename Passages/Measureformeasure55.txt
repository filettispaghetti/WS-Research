Provost
Who can do good on him?
Well, go, prepare yourself.
Knocking within

But, hark, what noise?
Heaven give your spirits comfort!
Exit CLAUDIO

By and by.
I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
For the most gentle Claudio.
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before

Welcome father.
DUKE VINCENTIO
The best and wholesomest spirts of the night
Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?
Provost
None, since the curfew rung.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Not Isabel?
Provost
No.
DUKE VINCENTIO
They will, then, ere't be long.
Provost
What comfort is for Claudio?
DUKE VINCENTIO
There's some in hope.
Provost
It is a bitter deputy.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:
He doth with holy abstinence subdue
That in himself which he spurs on his power
To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that
Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
But this being so, he's just.
Knocking within

Now are they come.
Exit Provost

This is a gentle provost: seldom when
The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.
Knocking within

How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste
