Rehearse that once more.

'Item: She hath more hair than wit,'--
LAUNCE
More hair than wit? It may be; I'll prove it. The
cover of the salt hides the salt, and therefore it
is more than the salt; the hair that covers the wit
is more than the wit, for the greater hides the
less. What's next?
SPEED
'And more faults than hairs,'--
LAUNCE
That's monstrous: O, that that were out!
SPEED
'And more wealth than faults.'
LAUNCE
Why, that word makes the faults gracious. Well,
I'll have her; and if it be a match, as nothing is
impossible,--
SPEED
What then?
LAUNCE
Why, then will I tell thee--that thy master stays
for thee at the North-gate.
SPEED
For me?
LAUNCE
For thee! ay, who art thou? he hath stayed for a
better man than thee.
SPEED
And must I go to him?
LAUNCE
Thou must run to him, for thou hast stayed so long
that going will scarce serve the turn.
SPEED
Why didst not tell me sooner? pox of your love letters!
Exit

LAUNCE
Now will he be swinged for reading my letter; an
unmannerly slave, that will thrust himself into
secrets! I'll after, to rejoice in the boy's correction.

DUKE
Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you,
Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.
