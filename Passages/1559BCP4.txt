haue receiued at hi# hand#, to set foorth hi# most worthy
praise, to heare hi# most holy word, and to aske those thing#
which be requisite & necessary, aswel for the body a# the soule.
Wherfore I pray and beseech you, a# many a# be here present,
to accompany me with a pure heart and humble voyce, vnto the
throne of the heauenly grace, saying after me.
¶ A generall confeon, to be ſaid of the whole Congregation
after the Minier, kneeling.
Lmighty and most mercifull Father, we haue
erred and strayed from thy waye#, like lost
sheepe we haue followed too much the deuice#
and desire# of our owne heart#. We
haue offended against thy holy Lawe#: We
haue left vndone those thing# which we
ought to haue done, and we haue done those
thing# which wee ought not to haue done, and there i# no
health in v#: but thou, O Lord, haue mercy vpon v# miserable 
offender#. Spare thou them O God, which confesse their
fault#, restore thou them that bee penitent, according to thy
promise# declared vnto mankinde, in Christ Jesu our Lord:
and grant, O most mercifull Father, for hi# sake, that we may
hereafter liue a godly, rightuou#, and sober life, to the glory of
thy holy Name. Amen.
¶ The abſolution or remion of ſinnes to be pronounced
by the Minier alone.
Lmighty God, the father of our Lord Jesu#
Christ, which desireth not the death of a sinner,
but rather that he may turne from hi# wickednesse
and lieu, and hath giuen power and commandement
to hi# Minister#, to declare and
pronounce to hi# people being penitent, the
absolution and remission of their sinne#: hee pardoneth and
absolueth all them which truly repent, and vnfainedly beleeue
hi# holy Gospel. Wherefore we beseech him to grant v# true
repentaunce and hi# holy Spirit, that those thing# may please
him, which we doe at thi# present, and that the rest of our life
hereafter may be pure and holy so that at the last we may come
to hi# eternall ioye, through Jesu# Christ our lord.
The people shall aunswere.
Amen. 
¶ Then all the Minier hegin the Lords prayer
with a loud voice.
Ur Father, which art in heauen, hallowed be thy
name. Thy Kingdome come. Thy will be done in
earth a# it i# in heauen. Giue v# thi# day our daily
bread. And forgiue v# our trespasse#, a# we forgiue
them that trespasse against v#. And lead v# not into temptation.
But deliuer v# from euill.
¶ Then likewiſe he all ſay.
O Lord, open thou our lip#.
