DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in adversity.
Officer
Good, now, hold thy tongue.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel
your blows.
ANTIPHOLUS
Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an
ass.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long
ears. I have served him from the hour of my
nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his
hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he
heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me
with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep;
raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with
it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when
I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a
beggar wont her brat; and, I think when he hath
lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.
Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and PINCH

DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or
rather, the prophecy like the parrot, 'beware the
rope's-end.'
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
Wilt thou still talk?
Beating him

Courtezan
How say you now? is not your husband mad?
ADRIANA
His incivility confirms no less.
Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;
Establish him in his true sense again,
And I will please you what you will demand.
LUCIANA
Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!
