among all them which are ƒanctified. I haue deƒired no mans
ƒiluer, gold, o° ve¥ure. Yea, you know your ƒelues, that theƒe hands
haue mini¥red vnto my nece±ities, and vnto them that were with
mee. I haue ƒhewed you all things, how that so labouring yee ought
to receiue the weake, and to remember the wo°ds of the Lo°de

Or elſe this third Chapter, of the fir Epile to Timothie.
His is a true ƒaying, If any man deƒire the o¤ice of a
Biƒhop, he desireth an hone¥ wo°k. A Biƒhop therefo°e
mu¥ be blamele±e, the huƒband of one wife, vigilant, ƒobre,
diƒcrete, a keeper of hoƒpitalitie, apt to teach, not
giuen to ouer much wine, no fighter, nor greedy of filthy lucre, but
gentle, abho°ring fighting, abho°ring couetouƒne±e, one that ruleth
well his own houƒe, one that hath child°en in ƒubiection with all
reuerence. Fo° if a man cannot rule his owne houƒe, how ƒhall hee
care for the Congregation of God? He may not be a yong Scholer,
le¥ he ƒwell, and fall into the iudgement of the euill ƒpeaker. He
mu¥ alƒo have a good repo°t of them which are without; le¥ hee fall
into rebuke, and ƒnare of the euill ƒpeaker.
 Likewiƒe mu¥ the Mini¥ers bee hone¥, not double tongued, not
giuen vnto much wine, neither grerdy of filthy lucre; but holding

p°ooued, and then let them mini¥er ƒo that no man be able to rep°ooue
them.
 Euen ƒo mu¥ their wiues be hone¥, not euill ƒpeakers: but sober
and faithfull in all things. Let the Deacons be the huƒbands of one
wife, and ƒuch as rule their child°en well, and their owne houƒholds:
Fo° they that mini¥er well get themƒelues a good degree, and great
liberty in the faith which is in Ch°i¥ Jeƒus. Theƒe things write I
vnto thee, tru¥ing to come ƒho°tly vnto thee: but if I tarry long, that then thou maye¥ haue yet knowledge, how thou oughte¥ to

the liuing God, the pillar and ground of trueth.
And without doubt, great is that my¥erie of godline±e: God was
ƒhewed in the fleƒh, was iu¥ified in the Spirit, was ƒeene among the
Angels, was p°eached vnto the Gentiles, was beleeued on in the
wo°ld, and receiued up in glory.
After this shall be read for the Goſpel a piece of the la Chapter
of Mathew, as followeth.
Eƒus came and ƒpake vnto them, ƒaying: All power is giuen vnto me in heauen and in earth: Goe ye therefo°e and teach all Nations,
baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the holy Gho¥, teaching them to obƒerue all things, whatƒoeuer
I haue commanded you : and loe, I am with you alway, euen
vntil the end of the wo°ld.
