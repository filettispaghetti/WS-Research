through Jesu# Christ our Lord. Amen.
God which by thy mightie power hast made all
thing# of naught, which also (after other thing#
set in order) didst appoint that out of man (created
after thine owne image and similitude) woman
should take her beginning : and knitting 
them together, diddest teach that it should neuer be lawfull to
put asunder those, whom thou by Matrimony hadst made one :
O God which haste consecrated the state of Matrimony to such
an excellent Mystery, that in it i# signified and represented the
spirituall mariage and vnitie betwixt Chnist and hi# Church :
Looke mercifully vpon these thy seruant#, that both thi# man
may loue hi# wife, according to thy word (a# Christe did loue
hi# spouse the Church, who gaue himselfe for it, louing and
cherishing it, euen a# hi# owne flesh) and also that thi# woman
may be louing and amiable to her husband a# Rachel, wise a#
Rebecca, faithfull and obedient a# Sara, and in all quietnesse,
sobrietie, and peace, be a folower of holy and godly matron#.
O Lord, blesse them both, and grant them to inherite thy
euerlasting Kingdome, through Jesu# Christ our Lord. Amen.
¶ Then all the Prie ſay,
Lmighty God, which, at the beginnyng did
create our first parent# Adam and Eue, and did
sanctifie and ioyne them together in marriage :
powre vpon you the riche# of hi# grace, sanctifie,
& blesse you, that ye may please him both in
body and soule, and liue together in holy loue,
vnto your liue# end. Amen.
¶ Then al begin the Communion. And after the Goſpel all be ſaid a
Sermon, wherein ordinarily (ſo oft as there is any mariage) the office of a
man and wife all be declared, according to holy Scripture, or if there be
no Sermon, the Minier all reade this that followeth.
Ll yee which be married, on which intend to take
the holy estate of Matrimony vpon you, heare
what holy Scripture doth say, a# touching the
duety of husband# toward# their wiue#, and
wiue# toward# their husband#.
Saint Paul in hi# Epistle to the Ephesian# the fifth Chapter,
doth giue thi# commandement to all married men, Yee
husband# loue your wiue#, euen a# Christ loued the Church,
and hath giuen himselfe for it, to sanctifie it, purging it in the
fountaine of water, through the word, that he might make it
vnto himselfe a glorious# Congregation, not hauing spot or
wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should bee holy and
blamelesse. So men are bound to loue their owne wiue#, a# 
their owne bodie#. Hee that loueth hi# owne wife loueth himselfe.
For neuer did any man hate hi# owne flesh, but nourisheth
and cherisheth it, euen a# the Lond doth the Congregation,
for we are member# of hi# body, of hi# flesh and of hi#
bone#. For thi# cause shall a man leaue father and mother,
