Lmighty God and mo¥ mercifull Father,
which of thine infinite goodne±e ha¥ giuen thy
onely and mo¥ deare beloued Son Jeƒus
Ch°i¥ to be our Redeemer and Autho° of
euerla¥ing life, who after that hee had made
perfect our Redemption by his death, and
was aƒcended into heauen, pow°ed downe his
gifts abondantly vpon men, making ƒome Apo¥les, some P°ophets, ƒome Euangeli¥s, ƒome Pa¥ours and
Doctours, to the edifying and making perfect his Congregation:
grant wee beƒeech thee, to this thy ƒervant ƒuch grace, that hee may
euermo°e be ready to ƒp°eade ab°oad thy Gospell, and glad tidings
of reconcilement to God, and to vƒe the autho°itie giuen vnto him,
not to de¥roy, but to ƒave, not to hurt, but to helpe: ƒo that he, as a
wiƒe and a faithfull ƒervant, giuing to thy family meate in due ƒea-
ƒon, may at the la¥ bee receiued into ioy, through Jeƒu Ch°i¥ our
Lo°d, who with thee, and the holy Gho¥ liueth and reigneth one
God, wo°ld without end. Amen.
Then the Archbiſhop and Biſhops preſent, ſhal lay their hands vpon the head of
the eleed Biſhop, the Archbiſhop ſaying.
Ake the holy Gho¥, and remember that thou ¥irre up the grace
of God, which is in thee, by impoƒicion of hands: fo° god hath not giuen vs the ƒpirite of feare, but of power, and loue, and ƒoberne±e.
