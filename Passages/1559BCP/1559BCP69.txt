the As.
Hen the twelve called the multitude of the Diƒciples together,
and ƒaid, It is not meet that we ƒhould leaue the wo°d of God,
and ƒerue tables. Wherefo°e b°eth°en, looke yee out among you,
ƒeuen men of hone¥ repo°t and full of the holy Gho¥ and wiƒdome,
to whom wee may commit this buƒine±e: but wee will giue our
ƒelues continually to p°aier, and to the admini¥ration of the wo°d.
And that ƒaying pleaƒed the whole multitude. And they choƒe Stephen,
a man ful of faith, and full of the holy Gho¥, and Philip, and P°ocho°us, and Nicano°, and Timon, and Permenas, and Nicholas
a conuert of Antioch. Theƒe they ƒet befo°e the Apo¥les: and when
they had p°ayed, they laid their hands on them. And the wo°d of
God increaƒed, and the nomber of the Diƒciples multiplied in Jeru-
ƒalem greatly, and a great company of the P°ie¥s, were obedient
vnto the faith.
