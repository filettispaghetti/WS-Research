¶ The Prie meeting the Corps at the Church ile, all ſaye, or elſe the
Prie and Clerkes all ſing, and ſo goe either into the Church, or
towards the graue.
Am the resurrection and the life (saith the Lord.)
He that beleeueth in me, yea, though he were dead,
yet shall he liue. And whosoeuer liueth, and belieueth
in me, shall not die for euer.
Iohn 11.
Know that my Redeemer liueth, and that I shall rise
out of the earth in the last day, and shal be couered
againe with my skinne, and shall see God in my flesh:
yea, and I my selfe shall behold him, not with other,
but with these same eye#.
Iob 19.
Ee brought nothing into thi# world, neither may we
carry any thing out of thi# world. The Lord giueth,
and the Lord taketh away. Euen a# it hath pleased
the Lord so commeth thing# to passe : Blessed be the
Name of the Lord.
1. Tim. 6.
Iob 1.
¶ When they come to the graue, while the Corps is made ready to bee laid
into the earth, the Prie all ſay, or the Prie, and Clerkes all ſing.
An that i# borne of a woman hath but a short time
to liue, and i# full of misery. Hee commeth vp, and i# cut downe like a flower, he fleeth a# it
were a shadow, and neuer continueth in one stay.
In the mid# of life we bee in death : of whom may we seeke
for succour but of thee, O Lord, which for our sinne# art iustly
displeased? Yet O Lord God most holy, O Lord most mighty,
Iob 14. 
O holy, and most mercifull Sauiour, deliuer v# not into the
bitter paine# of eternall death. Thou knowest Lord the secret#
of our heart#, shut not vp thy mercifull eye# to our prayer# :
but spare v# Lord moste holy, O God most mighty, O holy
and mercifull Sauiour, thou most worthy Judge eternall, suffer
v# not at our last houre for any paine# of death to fall from
thee.
¶ Then while the earth all be ca vpon the body by ſome anding by, the
Prie all ſay.
Orasmuch a# it hath pleased Almighty God of hi#
great mercy to take vnto himselfe the soule of our
deare brother here departed, we therfore commit hi#
body to the ground, earth to earth, ashe# to ashe#,
dust to dust, in sure and certain hope of resurrection to eternall
life, through our Lord Jesu# Christ, who shall change our vile
body that it may bee like vnto hi# gloriou# body, according to
the mighty working, whereby he i# able to subdue all thing# to
himselfe.
Then all be ſaid or ſung.
