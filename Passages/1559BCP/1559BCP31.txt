And because it i# requisite that no man should come to the holy
Communion, but with a full trust in God# mercy, and with a
quiet conscience: therfore if there be any of you, which by the
meane# aforesaid cannot quiet hi# owne conscience, but
requireth further comfort or counsell, then let him come to mee,
or some other discreet and learned minister of God# word, and 
open hi# griefe, that hee may receiue suche ghostly counsell,
aduice, and comfort, a# hi# conscience may bee relieued, and
that by the ministery of God# word, he may receiue comfort,
and the benefite of absolution, to the quieting of hi# conscience,
and auoyding of all scruple and doubtfulnesse.
¶ Then all the Prie ſay this exhortation.
Earely beloued in the Lord, yee that minde to come
to the holy Communion of the Body and Blood of
oure Sauiour Christ, must consider what S. Paul
writeth to the Corinthian#, how hee exhorteth all
person# diligently to trie and examine themselue#, before they
presume to eate of that Bread, and drinke of that Cup. For a#
the benefit i# great, if with a true penitent heart and liuely
faith, wee receiue that holy Sacrament (for then wee spiritually
eate the flesh of Christ, and drinke hi# blood, then wee
dwell in Christ and Christ in v#, wee be one wyth Christ, and
Christ with v#:) so i# the danger great, if we receiyue the same
vnworthily. For then wee bee guilty of the Body and Blood of
Christ our Sauiour: wee eate and drinke our owne
damnation, not considering the Lord# Body: wee kindle God#
wrath against v#, wee prouoke him to plague v# with diuer#
disease#, and sundry kinde# of death. Therefore if any of you
be a blasphemer of God, an hinderer, or slaunderer of hi#
word, an adulterer, or bee in malice or enuie, or in any other
greuou# crime, bewaile your sinne#, and come not to thi# holy
Table, lest after the taking of that holy Sacrament, the deuill
enter into you, a# he entred into Juda#, and fill you full of all
iniquitie#, and bring you to destruction both of bodye and
soule. Judge therefore your selue# (brethren) that yee be not
iudged of the Lord. Repent you truly for your sinne# past:
haue a liuely and stedfast faith in Christ our Sauiour. Amend
your liue#, and be in perfect charitie wyth all men, so shal yee
be meete partaker# of those holy mysterie#. And aboue all
thinge# yee must giue most humble and hearty thank# to God
the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, for the redemption
of the world, by the death and Passion of our Sauiour Christ,
both God and man, who did humble himselfe, euen to the
death vpon the Crosse, for v# miserable sinner# which lay in 
darckenesse, and shadow of death, that hee might make v# the
children of God, and exalt v# to euerlasting life. And to the
end that we should alway remember the exceeding great loue
of our Master and onely Sauiour Jesu# Christ, thu# diyng for
v#, and the innumerable benefit# which by hi# preciou# bloodsheading
he hath obtained to v#, hee hath instituted and
