vnkindenesse vnto God? Truely it i# a greate vnthankefulnesse
to say nay when ye be called, but the fault i# much greater,
when men stand by, and yet will neither eate nor drinke thi#
holy Communion with other. I pray you what can thi# be else,
but euen to haue the mysterie# of Christ in derision? It i# said
vnto all: Take yee and eate, take and drinke ye all of thi#.
Doe thi# in remebraunce of me. With what face then, or with
what countenaunce shall ye heare these word#? what will thi#
be else, but a neglecting, a despising, and mocking of the
Testament of Christ? Wherfore rather then yee should so doe,
depart you hence, and giue place to them that bee godly dysposed.
But when you depart, I beseech you ponder with your
selue#, from whom ye depart. Ye depart from the Lord#
Table: ye depart from your brethren, and from the banket of
most heauenly food. These thing# if ye earnestly consider ye
shall by God# grace, returne to a better mynde, for the obtaining
wherof, we shall make our humble petition# while we
shal receiue the holy Communion.
¶ And ſometime all this be ſaid alſo at the diſcretion
of the Curate.
Earely beloued, forasmuche a# our duety i# to rendre
to almighty God our heauenly father most
hearty thanke# for that he hath giuen hi# Sonne
our Sauiour Jesu# Christ not onely to die for v#,
but also to be our spiritual food, and sustenaunce, a# it i#
declared vnto v#, a# well by God# word a# by the holy Sacrament
of hi# blessed body and blood, the which being so
comfortable a thing to them which receiue it worthily and so
daungerou# to them that will presume to receiue it vnworthely:
my duty i# to exhort you to consider the dignitie of the
holy mystery, and the great peril of the vnworthy receiuing
therof, and so to search and examine your owne conscience#, a#
you shold come holy and cleane to a most godly and heuenly
Feast, so that in no wise you come but in the mariage garment,
required of God in holy Scripture, and so come and be receiued
a# worthy partaker# of such an heauenly Table, The
way and meane# therto i#: First to examine your liue# and
conuersation by the rule of God# Commandement# and whereinsoeuer
yee shall perceiue your selue# to haue offended either
by will, word, or deed, there bewaile your owne sinfull liue#,
and confesse your selue# to Almighty God, with full purpose of
amendement of life. And if yee shall perceiue your offence# to
bee such, a# be not onely against God, but also against your
neighbour#, then you shall reconcyle your selue# vnto them,
ready to make restitution and satisfaction according to the
vttermost of your power# for all iniurie# and wrong# done by
you to any other, and likewise being ready to forgiue other that
haue offended you a# you would haue forgiuene# of your
offence# at God# hand: for otherwyse the receiuing of the holy
Communion doth nothing el#e, but encrease your damnation.
