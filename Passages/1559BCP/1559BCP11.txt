Luke 1.
For he hath regarded : the lowlinesse
of hi# handmaiden.
For behold from henceforth : all generation#
shall call me blessed.
For he that i# mighty hath magnified
me : and holy i# hi# Name.
And hi# mercy I# on them that feare
him : throughout all generation#.
He hath shewed strength with hi# arme ; he hath scattered
the proud in the imagination of their heart#.
Hee hath put downe the mighty from their seat : and hath
exalted the humble and meeke.
He hath filled the hungry with good thing# : and the rich he
hath sent empty away.
