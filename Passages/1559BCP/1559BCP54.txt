to be enterprised, nor taken in hand vnaduisedly, lightly or
wantonly, to satisfie men# carnall lust# and appetite#, like
brute beast# that haue no vnderstanding, but reuerently, discreetly,
aduisedly, soberly, and in the feare of God, duely
considering the cause# for the which Matrimony wa# ordained.
One wa# the procreation of children, to be brought vp in the
feare and nurture of the Lord, and praise of God. Secondly, it
wa# ordained for a remedie against sinne and to auoid fornication,
that such person# a# haue not the gift of continency 
might marry, and keepe themselue# vndefiled member# of
Christ# body. Thirdly, for the mutuall societie, helpe, and comfort,
that the one ought to haue of the other, both in prosperity
and aduersitie, into the which holy estate these two person# present,
come now to be ioyned. Therefore if any man can shew
any iust cause, why they may not lawfully be ioyned together
let him now speake, or el#e hereafter for euer hold hi# peace.
And alſo ſpeaking vnto the perſons that all be
 married, he all ſay.
Require and charge you (a# you will answere
at the dreadful day of Judgement, when the
secret# of all heart# shall be disclosed) that if
either of you doe know any impediment, why
ye may not be lawfully ioyned together in
Matrimony, that ye confesse it. For be ye well
assured, that so many a# be coupled together, otherwise then
Godd# word doeth allow, are not ioyned together by God,
neither i# their Matrimony lawfull.
¶ At which day of mariage, if any man doe alledge and declare any impediment,
why they may not be coupled together in Matrimony by Gods
Law, or the Lawes of this Realme, and will be bound, and ſufficient
ſureties with him to the parties, or elſe put in a caution to the full value of
ſuch charges as the perſons to be married doe ſuaine, to prooue his allegation:
then the ſolemnization mu bee deferred vnto ſuch time as the
truth be tried. If no impediment be alleadged, then all the Curate ſay
vnto the man,
N. Ilt thou haue thi# woman to thy wedded wife, to
liue together after God# ordinance, in the holy
estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou loue her, comfort
her, honour, and keepe her, in sickenesse, and in health? and
forsakyng all other, keepe thee onely vnto her, so long a# you
both shall liue?
The man shall anſwere,
I will.
Then all the Prie ſay vnto the woman,
N. Ilt thou haue thi# man to thy wedded husband, to
liue together after God# ordinance in the holy
estate of Matrimonie? Wilt thou obey him and 
serue him, loue, honour, and keepe him, in sicknesse and in
health? and forsaking all other, keepe thee onely vnto him so
long a# you both shall liue?
