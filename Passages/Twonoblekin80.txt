The very powers that love 'em.

PIRITHOUS  Sir, they enter.

[Flourish of cornets. Enter Palamon and Arcite
and their Knights.]


THESEUS
You valiant and strong-hearted enemies,
You royal german foes, that this day come
To blow that nearness out that flames between you,
Lay by your anger for an hour and, dove-like,
Before the holy altars of your helpers,
The all-feared gods, bow down your stubborn
bodies.
Your ire is more than mortal; so your help be.
And as the gods regard you, fight with justice.
I'll leave you to your prayers, and betwixt you
I part my wishes.

PIRITHOUS  Honor crown the worthiest!
[Theseus and his train exit.]

PALAMON
The glass is running now that cannot finish
Till one of us expire. Think you but thus,
That were there aught in me which strove to show
Mine enemy in this business, were 't one eye
Against another, arm oppressed by arm,
I would destroy th' offender, coz--I would
Though parcel of myself. Then from this gather
How I should tender you.

ARCITE  I am in labor
To push your name, your ancient love, our kindred
Out of my memory, and i' th' selfsame place
To seat something I would confound. So hoist we
The sails that must these vessels port even where
The heavenly Limiter pleases.

PALAMON  You speak well.
Before I turn, let me embrace thee, cousin.
[They embrace.]
This I shall never do again.

ARCITE  One farewell.

PALAMON
Why, let it be so. Farewell, coz.
