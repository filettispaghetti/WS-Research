Mark 14:47	And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
Mark 14:48	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?
Mark 14:49	I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.
Mark 14:50	And they all forsook him, and fled.
Mark 14:51	And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:
Mark 14:52	And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
Mark 14:53	And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.
Mark 14:54	And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.
Mark 14:55	And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.
Mark 14:56	For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.
Mark 14:57	And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,
Mark 14:58	We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.
Mark 14:59	But neither so did their witness agree together.
Mark 14:60	And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?
Mark 14:61	But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?
Mark 14:62	And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
Mark 14:63	Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?
Mark 14:64	Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.
Mark 14:65	And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.
Mark 14:66	And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:
Mark 14:67	And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.
Mark 14:68	But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.
Mark 14:69	And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.
Mark 14:70	And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.
Mark 14:71	But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.
Mark 14:72	And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.
Mark 15:1	And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.
Mark 15:2	And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto them, Thou sayest it.
Mark 15:3	And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.
Mark 15:4	And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.
Mark 15:5	But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.
Mark 15:6	Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.
Mark 15:7	And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
Mark 15:8	And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.
Mark 15:9	But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
Mark 15:10	For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.
Mark 15:11	But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.
Mark 15:12	And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?
Mark 15:13	And they cried out again, Crucify him.
Mark 15:14	Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.
Mark 15:15	And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.
Mark 15:16	And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.
Mark 15:17	And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,
Mark 15:18	And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
Mark 15:19	And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.
Mark 15:20	And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.
Mark 15:21	And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.
Mark 15:22	And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
Mark 15:23	And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.
Mark 15:24	And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
