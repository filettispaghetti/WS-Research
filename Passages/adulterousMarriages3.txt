But because the Apostle or ra∣ther Christ by the Apostle dothe not permitte a woman to go from her husbād that is no fornicator,* therfore he forbiddeth her to ma∣ry that goeth away, whō he suffe¦reth to go away for fornication. For she of whom it is sayd, if she go away let her not marry: is suf∣fered vnder that condicion to go away that she should not marry. If therfore she chose not to mar∣ry, there is no cause why she shuld be prohibited to go away, as she of whom it is sayd, if she liue not continently, let her marry, and so is permitted to liue not continētly vpon this condicion that she mar∣ry. If therfore she chose to marry
Page  [unnumbered]
she cannot be compelled to liue cō¦tinently. Lyke as a woman refu∣syng to liue continently, is com∣pelled to marry, that her inconti∣nent life may not be damnable: so she goyng frō her husband is com¦pelled to remain vnmaried, that her goyng away may be not cul∣pable. But she shall be culpable if she go frō her husband without fornication, although she remain vnmaried. Therfore she is com∣maunded to remayne vnmaried, if she go away, that goeth away frō a fornicator. Seyng these thyn∣ges be thus, if we vnderstand the Apostle after that sorte, that we say to women, go not from your chast husbādes, but if ye wyl go, see that ye remain vnmaried: than wyll all those that delite to liue continently: suppose that they
Page  [unnumbered]
may lawfully go away without the consent of their husbandes. Whiche thyng seyng wee ought not to permitte, than it foloweth that the saiyng of the Apostle, (if she go away let her remaine vn∣maried,) we ought to teache that it is spoken of her, whō we haue lerned may lawfully go away for no cause but for fornication. Lest (if we teache otherwyse) by pre∣tence of cōtinentliuyng we trou∣ble christen mariages, and lest a∣gainst the most mercifull cōmaun¦dement of our Lord, we compel & driue into adulteryes menne that wyl not liue continently without their wiues, when thei be forsakē of their wyues that wyll not liue continently. And so likewyse of women.

Than this that the lord sayth,*
Page  [unnumbered]
not in that sermon I expounded, but in another place. Whosoe∣uer putteth awaye his wyfe but for the cause of fornication, and marieth another, committeth ad∣ultery: if we vnderstande it this waye, that whosoeuer putteth a∣way his wyfe for fornication and marieth another doth not commit adultery: Than it semeth in this matter yt there is not like forme & reason betwene the husbād & the wyfe, because the wyfe although she go from her husband for forni¦cation, & marieth another, yet she doth adultery: but ye mā if he put∣teth his wyfe awaye for the same cause & marieth another, doth no adulteri. But if ther be like forme in both: than both be adulterours if thei marry other, although thei separate theim selues for fornica∣tion.
Page  [unnumbered]
And that there is like forme in this matter betwene the man & the wyfe, the Apostle sheweth there (wherof I must often make menciō) wher when he had sayd, the wyfe hath not power of her owne body, but the man, he added and sayd likewyse, the man hath not power of his owne body, but the woman.

Than (say you) why did Christ adde to his saiyng,* the cause of fornication, & did not rather say generally, whosoeuer putteth a∣way his wyfe & marieth another committeth adultery, if he also cō¦mitteth adultery whiche putting awaye his wyfe for fornication, marieth another? I thīke because Christe would make mencion of that whiche is the greater fault. For who denieth but it is more
Page  [unnumbered]
adultery to putte his wyfe away without cause of fornication and marry another, than puttyng her away for fornication to marry an other, not because this is no adul∣tery, but because it is lesse adul∣tery, whē after the fyrst wyfe put away for fornication the second is maried. For sainct Iames the Apostle vsing a like speche, sayth To him that knoweth to do well and do not, it is synne. Is it ther∣fore no synne to him that kno∣weth not to do well, and therfore doth it not? yes truely it is synne, but this is greater, if he bothe knowe, and do not. And this is not therfore no synne, because it is lesse. But to speake then both after one sort, like as whosoeuer putteth away his wife, excepting the cause of fornication, and ma∣rieth
Page  [unnumbered]
another, cōmitteth adulte∣ry: Euen so whosoeuer knoweth good & doth it not, synneth. But like as it cā not be well sayd here therfore if he knowe not, he syn∣neth not, (for there be also sinnes of those that bee ignoraunt, al∣though thei be lesse than of those that knowe: Euen so it can not be well sayd there, Therfore if he putteth away his wife for forni∣cation, and maryeth another, he cōmitteth no adultery. For there is adultery also of theim whiche marry other, forsakyng their for∣mer wyues for fornication, but yet lesse than of those that marry other, forsakyng their wyues not for fornication. For like as it is sayd, to him that knoweth good and dothe it not, it is synne: euen so this also may bee sayd, to him
Page  [unnumbered]
that forsaketh his wife without cause of fornication and maryeth another, it is adultery. Therfore like as if we say, whosoeuer ma∣ryeth a woman that is forsaken of her husband not for fornica∣tion, cōmitteth adultery, without doubt we say true: and yet we do not deliuer him from that cryme that marieth a woman whiche is putte awaye for fornication, but doubte not but bothe bee adulte∣rors, Euen so we pronounce him an adulteror, that wtout cause of fornication forsaketh his wyfe & marieth another, and yet wee doo not therfore defend him from the spot of that cryme, that putteth away his wyfe for fornication & maryeth another. For although one be more than another, yet we knowe theim bothe to be adulte∣rors.
Page  [unnumbered]
For there is no man so vn∣reasonable, that wyll deny him to bee an adulteror that marieth a woman whom her husband hath put away for fornication, when he wyll call him an adulteror that maryeth her that is putte awaye without fornication. After this sorte therfore these be both adul∣terors. Wherfore when we say, whosoeuer maryeth her whō her husband hath put away without cause of fornication, committeth adultery: we speake it of one of theim, & yet do not therfore deny him to bee an adulteror that ma∣rieth her whom her husband hath putte away for fornication. So when both be adulterors, that is to say, both he that puttethaway his wyfe without cause of forni∣cation and maryeth another, and
Page  [unnumbered]
also he that puttyng awaye his wyfe for fornicatiō, coupleth him selfe to another: Truely when we reade this of one of them, we may not vnderstande it so, as though by him the other wer denyed to be an adulteror, because he is not ex∣pressed. But if sainct Mathewe the Euangelist make this hard to be vnderstāded, by expressyng the one kynde, and kepyng in silence the other: did not the other Euan∣gelistes comprehēd both so gene∣rally, that it may be vnderstanded of bothe? For in sainct Markes gospel it is thus written, whoso∣euer putteth away his wyfe, and maryeth another, committeth ad∣ultery vpon her: and if the wyfe putteth away her husbād and bee maryed to another, she cōmitteth adulterye. And in sainct Lukes
Page  [unnumbered]
gospel thus. Euery mā that put∣teth away his wyfe, and maryeth another, is an adulteror, and he that marieth her that is put away of her husbande, is an adulteror. Than what are wee that do say, there is one that puttyng awaye his wife & mariyng another, is an adulteror, And there is another that doyng the same thyng is no adulteror: seyng the gospel sayth, euery manne is an adulteror that doth it. Therefore if whosoeuer dothe it, that is to say, puttyng a∣way his wyfe, maryeth another, is an adulteror: without doubte than they bee bothe adulterors, both he that without fornication and he that for fornication put∣teth away his wyfe. For that is, whosoeuer putteth away, that is to say, euery one yt putteth away.

*And whē I brought furth the wordes of S. Mathewes gospel I dyd not skyppe ouer that was writtē (and maryeth another) and sayd thus, (he commytteth adul∣tery) as I can not tell why it is thought so to you: but I put in the wordes whiche be red in the long sermon that the Lord made vpō the mountaine. For that toke I on hād to intreate vpon, which wordes bee there red so as I put theim, that is to say, whosoeuer putteth away his wyfe except the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery, & he that ma∣ryeth her that is loosed from her husbande, commytteth adultery. Where although diuers exāples of bookes haue in diuers wordes the same sence when it is inter∣pretated: yet they do not diffre frō
Page  [unnumbered]
that is vnderstand of it. For some copyes haue, Whosoeuer putteth away, Other haue, euery manne that putteth away. Lykewise, some haue, except the cause of for¦nication, other, besyde the cause of fornication, other, but for the cause of fornication. Lykewise, some haue, he that maryeth her yt is losed frō her husband is an ad∣ulteror: other haue, he that ← marri → ∣eth her that is dimissed or put a∣way of her husband is an adulte∣ror. Where I suppose you see that it maketh no matter for one & the same sentence, although this last sentēce, that is to say, he that maryeth her that is put from her husband, is an adulteror, Diuers bookes bothe Greke and Latine haue it not in that sermō that the Lord made vpon the mountaine.
Page  [unnumbered]
And I suppose therefore because this sentence may bee thought there to be explicated, in this that is sayd before. He maketh her to commit adultery. Howe can she that is put away bee made an adultresse except he that shal mar¦ry her be made an adulteror?

The wordes also that you put in,* wherfore you thought, that he cōmytted no adultery, that put awaye his wyfe for the cause of fornication, and maryed another: be verely obscure and darkely put in. Wherfore I meruail not if the reader do stycke at the vnderstā∣dyng of them, but yet they be not in that sermō of our Lord which I than intreated, when I wrote these thynges that moued you when you red thē. For in another place the same Mathewe calleth
Page  [unnumbered]
that Christ spake those wordes, not when he made the long sermō vpon the mountayn, but when he was asked of the Pharisies, whe¦ther it was lawful to a man for a∣ny cause to putte away his wyfe. But that whiche is not vnderstā∣ded by sainct Mathewe, may bee vnderstanded by other Euangeli∣stes. Wherfore when we reade in sainct Mathewes gospel, whoso∣euer putteth awaye his wyfe but for fornicatiō, or rather this that is red in the greke text, besyde the cause of fornication, and marieth another, is an adulteror: Wee ought not by & by to thynke him no adulteror, that for the cause of fornicatiō putteth away his wife and maryeth another, but yet bee in doubt tyl we cōsult and reade ye gospel of other Euāgelistes that
Page  [unnumbered]
write of the same matter. What & if all be not written by S. Ma∣thewe that pertaineth to this ma∣tier, but a part is so written, that the whole may be vnderstāded of the part, which thyng S. Marke and sainct Luke as it were ma∣kyng it plaine, had rather speake the whole, that the full sentence may appeare? Seyng therefore fyrst, not doubting that to be true that is red in S. Mathewe, who soeuer putteth away his wife for the cause of fornication, and ma∣rieth another, is an adulteror: we do aske, whether only he is an ad¦ulteror in mariyng another wife, that besyde the cause of fornica∣tion putteth awaye his former wyfe: or els euery man that put∣teth away his wyfe and maryeth another, that he may be also inclu¦ded
Page  [unnumbered]
that putteth away his wyfe for fornication. Shall it not bee answered to vs by saint Markes gospell, why aske you, whether the one bee an adulteror and not the other? Whosoeuer putteth a∣way his wyfe & maryeth another cōmytteth adultery. Shall it not also bee sayd to vs by S. Lukes gospel, why dout you whether he for the cause of fornicatiō putteth away his wyfe and maryeth an∣other, bee an adulteror or no? E∣uery man that putteth away his wyfe and maryeth another, is an adulteror. And because it is not lawfull to say the Euangelistes do not agree in one sence and one vnderstandyng, althoughe they speake of one thyng in dyuers wordes, therfore we must vnder∣stande, that it pleased sainct Ma∣thew
Page  [unnumbered]
to signifie the whole by the part, and to be of the same mynde, not that one man that putteth a∣way his wyfe, and maryeth ano∣ther, that is to say, he that put∣teth her away beside the cause of fornication is an adulteror, and another man that putteth away hiswife for fornitation, is no ad∣ulteror, but euery man that put∣teth away his wife and maryeth another, should not bee doubted, but that he is an adulteror.

For that also that foloweth in sainct Luke,* he that maryeth a woman that is put away from her husbād, is an adulteror, howe is it true? Howe is he an adulte∣ror, but because she whō he ma∣rieth is yet another mans wife, so long as he liueth that did put her away? For if he haue carnal copu¦lation
Page  [unnumbered]
with his owne wyfe, and not with another mannes wyfe, than commytteth he no adultery. But he doth commytte adultery. Therfore she is another mannes wife with whom he kepeth com∣pany. Moreouer if she be another mannes wyfe, that is to say, his wife that put her awai, although she bee put away for fornication, yet she ceasseth not to be the wife of him that did putte her away. But if she cease to bee his wyfe, than is she wyfe to him that ma∣ried her the tyme. And if she bee his wyfe, then is not he to bee iudged an adulteror, but an husband. But because the scrip∣ture calleth him not an husband, but an adulteror, therfore she is yet his wyfe that did put her a∣way for fornicatiō. And therfore
Page  [unnumbered]
what woman soeuer he maryeth that putteth awaye his former wyfe for fornication, she is an adulteresse, because she compa∣nyeth with another wyues hus∣band. Than howe can it be that he should be no adulteror, when it is certaine that she commytteth adultery whom he maryeth.

Nowe let vs see and considre this that the Apostle sayth.* But to other, I say, not the Lord, be∣yng about to speake to vnequall mariages. (Unequal mariages is when bothe the parties bee not Christians, but the one parte.) Whiche saiyng, me thynke, he sayd by the way of exhortacion & admonishement, for because the partie christened be it manne or wyfe, may lawfully forsake and put away the other partie that is
