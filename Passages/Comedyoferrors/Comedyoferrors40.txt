Courtezan
Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!
PINCH
Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
Striking him

PINCH
I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,
To yield possession to my holy prayers
And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven!
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
ADRIANA
O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
You minion, you, are these your customers?
Did this companion with the saffron face
Revel and feast it at my house to-day,
Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut
And I denied to enter in my house?
ADRIANA
O husband, God doth know you dined at home;
Where would you had remain'd until this time,
Free from these slanders and this open shame!
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
Dined at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
And did not she herself revile me there?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.
