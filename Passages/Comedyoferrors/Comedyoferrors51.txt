And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence
And in a dark and dankish vault at home
There left me and my man, both bound together;
Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
I gain'd my freedom, and immediately
Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech
To give me ample satisfaction
For these deep shames and great indignities.
ANGELO
My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.
DUKE SOLINUS
But had he such a chain of thee or no?
ANGELO
He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,
These people saw the chain about his neck.
Second Merchant
Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
Heard you confess you had the chain of him
After you first forswore it on the mart:
And thereupon I drew my sword on you;
And then you fled into this abbey here,
From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
I never came within these abbey-walls,
Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:
I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!
And this is false you burden me withal.
DUKE SOLINUS
Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
If here you housed him, here he would have been;
If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:
You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here
Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.
Courtezan
He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
DUKE SOLINUS
Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?
Courtezan
As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.
