ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
I will not stay to-night for all the town;
Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.
Exeunt

ACT V

SCENE I. A street before a Priory.

Enter Second Merchant and ANGELO
ANGELO
I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you;
But, I protest, he had the chain of me,
Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.
Second Merchant
How is the man esteemed here in the city?
ANGELO
Of very reverend reputation, sir,
Of credit infinite, highly beloved,
Second to none that lives here in the city:
His word might bear my wealth at any time.
Second Merchant
Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse

ANGELO
'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
Which he forswore most monstrously to have.
Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.
Signior Antipholus, I wonder much
That you would put me to this shame and trouble;
And, not without some scandal to yourself,
With circumstance and oaths so to deny
This chain which now you wear so openly:
Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,
You have done wrong to this my honest friend,
Who, but for staying on our controversy,
Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:
This chain you had of me; can you deny it?
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
I think I had; I never did deny it.
Second Merchant
Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
Second Merchant
