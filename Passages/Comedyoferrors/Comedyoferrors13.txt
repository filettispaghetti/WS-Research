If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
And fashion your demeanor to my looks,
Or I will beat this method in your sconce.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I
had rather have it a head: an you use these blows
long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce
it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
Dost thou not know?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
Shall I tell you why?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath
a wherefore.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--
For urging it the second time to me.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,
When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme
nor reason?
Well, sir, I thank you.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
Thank me, sir, for what?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for
something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
In good time, sir; what's that?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Basting.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.
