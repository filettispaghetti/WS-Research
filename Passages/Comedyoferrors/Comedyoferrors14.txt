ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
Your reason?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another
dry basting.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a
time for all things.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
By what rule, sir?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald
pate of father Time himself.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
Let's hear it.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
There's no time for a man to recover his hair that
grows bald by nature.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
May he not do it by fine and recovery?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the
lost hair of another man.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,
so plentiful an excrement?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;
and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF SYRACUSE
Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth
it in a kind of jollity.
