DUKE SOLINUS
Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.
I think you are all mated or stark mad.
Exit one to Abbess

AEGEON
Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:
Haply I see a friend will save my life
And pay the sum that may deliver me.
DUKE SOLINUS
Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.
AEGEON
Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?
And is not that your bondman, Dromio?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Within this hour I was his bondman sir,
But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:
Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.
AEGEON
I am sure you both of you remember me.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;
For lately we were bound, as you are now
You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?
AEGEON
Why look you strange on me? you know me well.
ANTIPHOLUS
I never saw you in my life till now.
AEGEON
O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
And careful hours with time's deformed hand
Have written strange defeatures in my face:
But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
Neither.
AEGEON
Dromio, nor thou?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
No, trust me, sir, nor I.
AEGEON
I am sure thou dost.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever a
man denies, you are now bound to believe him.
AEGEON
Not know my voice! O time's extremity,
Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
In seven short years, that here my only son
Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
