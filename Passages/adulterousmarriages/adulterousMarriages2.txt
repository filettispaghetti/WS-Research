A woorke of the holy bishop S. Augustine concernyng adulterous mariages written by him to Pollentius, diuided into two bookes, very necessary to be knowen of all men and women.

LONNDINI. ANNO. 1550.

The fyrst booke.

RIGHT welbelo∣ued brother Pollē∣tius,* the firste que∣stiō of those which you writyng vnto me intreated as by way of consultacion,* is that the Apostle sayth, To those that bee in mariage, I commaunde, not I, but the Lorde, that a wyfe do not go from her husbād, but if she go from him, that she remayne vn∣maried, or els be reconcyled to her husband again. And that an hus∣bande putte not away his wyfe. Whether it ought so to bee taken and vnderstonded that the womā is prohibited to marye, whiche goeth from her husband without cause of fornication (for that is your opiniō): or els, as I thought in those bookes whiche manye
Page  [unnumbered]
yeres ago I wrote vpon the ser∣mon in sainct Mathewes gospell whiche our sauiour made vpō the mountaine, that he commaunded those women to remaine vnma∣ried which did go from their hus∣bandes for that cause whiche is only permitted, that is to say, the cause of fornication. For you thynke that a woman goyng frō her husbande ought not than to marye, if she go away beyng not compelled by any fornicatiō of her husband. And you considre not, if her husband geue no cause of for∣nication, that than she ought not to remaine vnmaried if she go a∣way, but she ought not at all to go frō him. For truely she that is cōmaunded to remaine vnmaried if she go from her husband, hath not the libertie of goyng awaye
Page  [unnumbered]
taken from her, but the libertie to be maried. Whiche saiyng of you if it be true, than is libertie geuen to those women that be disposed to liue in continencie, not to tarry nor regarde the consent of their husbandes, that the saiyng of the Apostle, (let not a woman go frō her husband) should seme to bee commaunded to theim that may chose, not continencie, but suche a deuorse as may bee lawfull to ioyne with other in mariage. Therfore it shalbe lauful to those women that loue to desyre no com¦pany of mā nor to beare the yoke of mariage, to forsake their hus∣bandes yea without any cause of fornication and accordyng to the Apostles saiyng to remain vnma∣ried. And men likewyse (for there is like forme in both) if they wyl
Page  [unnumbered]
liue continētly, may without the consent of their wyues forsake them, & remaine without any ma∣riage. For than (as you thynke) they may seke newe mariages, if the deuorse be for the cause of for¦nication. But when that cause is not, than it foloweth (after your mynd) that the wyfe either ought not to go from her husband, or if she go from him, to remaine with out mariage, or els to returne to her former husband again. Ther∣fore whan there is no cause of for¦nication, it shalbe lawful to either of theim to chose one of these thre thynges, either not to go one frō the other, or if either parte go a∣way, to remaine so, or if they do not remain so, then not to seke thē another, but to returne to their former husband or wyfe againe.

And where is than that the same Apostle would not yt either of ye maryed parties shuld defraud the other in their carnall debt,* no not for a tyme, & for this cause al∣so that they might wholy & with more feruent diligēce applie them selues to praier, but by their mu∣tual consent? Howe shall this be saued that the Apostle sayth.* But for fornicatiōs, let euery husbād haue his wyfe, & euery wife haue her husband. And let the husbād pay his debt to his wyfe, and like¦wyse the wyfe to her husbande. The wyfe hath not power of her body but the husband, & likewise the husband hath not power of his body but the wyfe. How shal this be true, except when the one partie wyll not, the other partie may not liue in continencie? For
Page  [unnumbered]
if the wyfe may so put away her husband that she may remain vn¦maried, then the husbād hath not power of her body, but she her self Whiche is also vnderstāded of the husband. Moreouer when it is sayd, whosoeuer putteth awaye his wyfe,* exceptyng the cause of fornication, maketh her to bee an adultresse: Howe shall wee vn∣derstande this saiyng, but that a man isprohibite to put away his wyfe, if there be no cause of for∣nication? and it is tolde why? lest he make her to bee an adultresse. Truely therefore, because al∣though she put not him away, but be putte away her selfe, she shall be an adultresse if she marry.

Therfore for this great harme and inconuenience,* it is not law∣full for a man to putte away his
Page  [unnumbered]
wyfe, but for the cause of forni∣cation. For then in puttyng her awaye he dothe not make her an adultresse, but putteth away an adultresse. What if the man say, I put away my wyfe without a∣ny cause of fornication, but for that he wyll liue chast, in conti∣nencie: shal we therfore say that he dothe lawfully that he dothe? Who dare say so, that vnderstā∣deth the wyll of the Lord, saiyng that he would not haue the wyfe put away, no not because the mā would liue sole and chast, which excepted only the cause of fornica¦tion? But lette vs returne to the very wordes of the Apostle, sai∣yng:* To theim that bee in mari∣age I commaunde, not I but the Lord, that the wyfe go not from her husband, but if she go, to re∣maine
Page  [unnumbered]
vnmaried. And let vs aske of him, & as it were consult with him beyng present. Why diddest thou say O Apostle, if she go frō her husband let her remayne vn∣maried? Is it lawful for her to go away from him, or is it not law∣ful? If it be not lauful: why doest thou commaunde her goyng from her husbād to remain vnmaried? But if it bee lawfull, than truely there is a cause why it should be lawfull. This cause with no ser∣chyng is founden but onely that which our sauiour excepted, that is to say, the cause of fornication. And therfore the Apostle cōmaun¦ded not a wyfe that did go from her husband, to remaine vnma∣ried, except she went from him for that cause, for whiche onely it is lawfull for a wyfe to go from her
Page  [unnumbered]
husband. For where it is sayd, I commaunde her not to go away, but if she do go away, to remaine vnmaried: God forbyd that she that so goeth away that she must remaine vnmaried, should do any thyng against this commaunde∣ment. Howe therfore is she com∣maunded to remaine vnmaried if she go away, except ye vnderstād her that may lawfully go away, which is not lawful to any wyfe, but in case her husband committe fornication? Who is it that wyll say, if a wyfe go frō her husband without cause of fornication, let her remain vnmaried: seyng that she may not at all go frō him but for fornication? Therefore I thynke that you nowe perceiue, howe muche this your vnderstā∣dyng is contrarie to the bonde of
Page  [unnumbered]
mariage, where God would not that continencie should bee taken on hand, but by the mutual agre∣ment & cōsent of both the parties.

But let vs open the matter a lytle playner,* and as it were sette the thyng before our eyes. Put the case, that continent life plea∣seth the woman, but not the man. The woman goeth from him, and begynneth to liue cōtinently, she for her part wil liue chast, but she shal make her husband an adulte∣ror (which God wyll not) because he, whē he will not liue cōtinētly, wyll seke another woman. What shall wee say to the woman, but that the churche sayth in an hol∣som doctrine, pay thy debt to thy husband, lest whyles thou sekest howe to be more honoured, he do fynde howe to bee damned. For
Page  [unnumbered]
this would we say to him also, if he would liue cōtinently without thy good wyll. For thou hast not power of thy body but he, like as he hath not power of his body but thou. Do not defraude one ano∣ther but by comon consent. When we haue sayd these & other thyn∣ges that pertain to this purpose, doth it content you that the womā should answer vs after your opi∣nion, I am obediēt to the Apostle that sayth, I commaunde a wyfe not to go from her husband, but if she do go, to remaine vnmaried, or els to be reconciled to her hus∣band. Loo I haue gone from my husbande, and I wyll not bee re∣conciled, but wyl remaine vnma∣ried. For he sayth not, if she go a∣way, lette her remaine vnmaried tyl she be reconciled to her husbād
Page  [unnumbered]
but let her remaine vnmaried, or els be reconciled to her husbande. And he sayth let her do either this or that. He hath permitted one of the two to be chosen, & cōpelleth not to take the one. I haue chosē to remaine vnmaried, and so do I fulfil the cōmaundement. Correct me, blame me, refuse me, vse what seueritie you wyll if I do marry.

What can I say again to this woman, but this. Thou doest not vnderstand the Apostle well? For he would not haue commaunded the woman to remayne vnmaried if she go frō her husband, but on∣ly suche a womā as may lawfully go frō him, that is to say, for that one cause, whiche is therfore not expressed there, because it is most knowen, whiche is fornication. For god our master excepted that
Page  [unnumbered]
cause onely, when he spake of puttyng away a wyfe, & did geue vs to vnderstande, that the lyke forme was also to be kept in the husbande, for not onely the wyfe hath not power of her body but the man: but also the mā hath not power of his body but the wyfe. Therefore when thou canst not accuse thy husbād of fornication, howe doest thou thynke to excuse thy goyng frō him by liuyng vn∣maried, from whom it is not law¦full for the to go at all? When the woman shal heare these thynges of vs, I suppose she wyll answer vs thus againe, and say that she remaineth therfore vnmaried, be∣cause she went from her husband without any fornication on his part. For if he had doone fornica∣tion, then it had been lawfull not
Page  [unnumbered]
onely to go from him, but also to marry againe.

She can not say this, seyng that you are ashamed to geue that licence to women.* For you sayd, if a mā put away his wyfe for ad∣ultry, and marry another, the wo∣man onely shall haue the shame. But if a wyfe put away her hus∣band for the same cause, and bee married → to another, not onely the man but also the womā shal haue the shame. For whiche your sai∣yng you made this reason, That men wyll say, she went therfore from her husbande, because she would marry another man. And if that man be perchance suche as the other was (for it is likely and easely for menne to faull into that kynde of vice) if she put him also away, & marry to the thyrd: then
Page  [unnumbered]
they wyl say more and more that she desireth to haue a gret nūbre of husbandes. And by this reason you cōclude & say. These thinges thus intreated and discussed, the woman must tolerate her husbād or els remayne vnmaryed. You haue geuen good counsail to wo∣mē, that seyng they know that it is permitted vnto them to marry other, if they put away their for∣mer husbādes for fornication, yet thei shuld not do it for the shame, but rather tolerate their adulte∣rous husbandes, lest by this occa∣sion they might seme to haue a wyl to be ioyned with many men, because it is hard for a womā not to fynd suche a man to marry, as he was whom she put away, be∣cause men be prone to this vyce. Seyng therfore we say that it is
Page  [unnumbered]
not lawfull for a womā that put∣teth away her husband for forni∣cation, to marry another: and you say that it is lawful, but not expe¦dient: Than wtout doubt we both say that she ought not to marrye that putteth away her husband for fornicatiō. But this differēce there is, that when both the par∣ties be christened, wee say that a womā puttyng away her husbād for fornication, may not marry an other, and that she may not put away her husband without the cause of fornication. But you say that a woman may not marry an other, if she put away her husbād without any cause of fornicatiō, But if she do putte him away for that cause, that than it is not ex∣pedient for her to marry, because of the shame and reproche. And
Page  [unnumbered]
so you permit a woman that shal not marry, to go from her husbād be he a fornicator or none at all.
