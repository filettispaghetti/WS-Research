an infidele: therfore not the Lord but the Apostle forbyddeth that to bee done. For that the Lorde forbiddeth, may not be done at al. Therfore the Apostle dothe ex∣hort and admonishe the parties that haue receiued the fayth, not to vse their licēce permitted them in forsakyng the infidele parties, that there may bee an occasion to wynne many to the fayth. But you thynke that it is not lawfull for the christians to putte away the infideles that bee maryed to them, because the Apostle forbid∣deth it: When as I say, it is law∣full, because the Lord dothe not forbid it, but not expedient, be∣cause the Apostle doth counsail it not to bee done, who also geueth a reason why it is not expedient to bee doone, although it be law∣full

he sayth.* When I was free from all men, I made my selfe seruant of all men, that I might wynne many men. When he had sayd a lytle before: Haue not we power to take our meate and drynke? Haue not wee licence to leade a∣bout with vs a woman a syster as the other Apostles and the Lordes brethren & Peter? Haue I onely and Barnabas no power thus to do? Who doth euer go on warfare at his owne wages and charges? who doth plant a vyne∣yarde, and eateth not of the fruite of it? who is a shepeherd and ta∣keth not of the milke of ye flocke? And a lytle after he sayth: If o∣ther men haue this power ouer you, why not we rather? But we haue not vsed this power, but suffre all thynges, least we geue

any stop to the gospel of Christ. And a lytle after he sayth: What rewarde shall I haue, that prea∣chyng the gospell, do make the gospel to be at no cost or charge to the receiuer, and do not abuse my power in the gospel. And by and by he putteth after, that I sayd a lytle before, when I was free frō all men, I made my selfe seruaunt of all men, that I might wynne many. Lykewise in ano∣ther place concernyng thynges pertainyng to men, he sayth:* All thynges be lawfull to me, but I wil be brought vnder the power of nothyng. The meate is for the bely, & the bely is for the meate, but God shal cause to cease both the bely & the meate. Lykewise in another place concernyng the same. All thynges be lawful,* but
Page  [unnumbered]
all thynges be not expedient, all thinges be lawfull, but all thyn∣ges do not edifye. Let no manne seeke that is his owne, but that is another mannes. And to shew wherof he spake, he sayd: What soeuer is solde in the market, eat of it, askyng & serchyng nothyng for conscience sake. And yet in another place he sayth: I wyll not eate fleshe for euermore,* lest I should offend my brother. And lykewise in another place: All thinges be cleane,* but it is euil to that man that eateth by offensiō. What is this (al thynges be law¦full? Uerely this, (all thynges be cleane. (And what is this (but al thinges be not expediēt)? Uerely this (but it is euil to that man that eateth by offension. Thus he sheweth that thynges whiche
Page  [unnumbered]
be lawfull, that is to say, whiche be prohibite by no commaunde∣ment of the Lorde, ought rather to be ordered as they be expediēt, not by the appointment of lawe, but by the counsail of charitee. These bee the thynges that bee further bestowed vpon the woun¦ded mā, whiche was brought by the mercyfulnes of the Samari∣tane to the Inne to be cured and made whole. And therfore they be called not commaunded of the Lord, although they be admoni∣shed of the Lord to bee done and offered, that we should vnderstād them so muche to bee the more thankefull as they be declared to be voluntary and not due.

But in suche thynges that be of this sorte,* that although they be lauful yet thei be not expediēt:
Page  [unnumbered]
It may not be sayd in them, this is good, but that is better, as it is sayd:* He that geueth his vir∣gyn to mariage doth well, and he that geueth not his virgyn to mariage dothe better, for there both be lawful, and the one som∣tymes, somtymes the other is ex∣pediēt. For to those women that liue not syngle cotinently, it is ex¦pedient to marry, & so that is law¦full, is expedient. But to theim that haue vowed continencie, it is neither lawfull nor expedient. Moreouer it is lawfull to go frō an infidele husband, but not ex∣pedient. And to remain with him if he consent to dwel with her, is both lawfull and expedient. For if it were not lawful it could not be expediēt. One thyng therfore may be lawfull, and not expediēt:
Page  [unnumbered]
But it can not be expedient that is vnlawfull. And for that cause not all lawfull thynges be expe∣dient, but all vnlawfull thynges be not expedient. For lyke as e∣uery one that is redemed by the bloudde of Christ, is a man or a woman: but not euery one that is a man or a woman is redemed by the bloudde of Christ: Euen so euery thyng that is not lauful is not expedient, but not euery thyng that is not expedient is al∣so vnlawfull. For there be law∣full thynges that be not expedi∣ent as we haue learned by the Apostles testimony.

But it is herd to define by a∣ny vniuersal rule,* what differēce is betwene that is vnlawful and therfore not expedient, and that is lawful and yet not expedient.
Page  [unnumbered]
For a man wyll soone say, euery thyng that is not expedient to be done, is synne, but euery sinne is vnlawful, therfore euery thyng not expedient, is vnlawfull. And than where be those thinges the Apostle sayth be lawful, but not expedient, if euery thyng that is not expediēt be vnlawful? wher∣fore, because we may not doubte but the Apostle sayd true, and we dare not say that any synnes be lawfull: Than it foloweth wee must say, that some thing is done that is not expediēt, & yet if it be lawfull it is not synne, although it be not to be done, because it is not expedient. But if it bee thought an absurditee, that any thyng should be done that is not expedient, and that he should be sayd not to haue synned that did
Page  [unnumbered]
it: we must vnderstand that it is called an absurditee by ye custome of speche, which custom of speche extendeth so farre, that we say, beastes hauyng no reason ought to bee beaten when they faut or synne. But to synne, properly per¦tayneth to nothyng but to him that vseth the reasonable election of frewyl, whiche among al mor∣tal liuyng creatures, is geuen to none but to manne. But it is one thyng when we speake properly, and another thyng when wee bo∣rowe wordes either by abusyng of them, or els by translation frō other thynges.

That we may therfore labor (if we can) by some propre differēce to put distinction betwene that is lawfull and not expedient,* and that is vnlawful and therfore not
Page  [unnumbered]
expedient: Me thinke, those thin∣ges be lawful and not expedient, whiche by righteousnes be per∣mitted before God, but for offen∣dyng of men, ought to bee auoy∣ded, least therby they bee stopped from saluatiō, and those thynges be vnlawfull and therfore not ex¦pediēt, that be forbidden by righ∣teousnes it selfe to be done at all, although thei be praised of those to whose knowledge they bee brought. Whiche thyng if it be so, than onely vnlawful thynges be prohibited of God, that thyn∣ges lawfull & not expedient, may bee auoyded not by the bonde of lawe, but by the free beneuolence of mans discrecion. Therfore if it were not lawful to put away the infidele husbād or wyfe, the lord would haue forbydden it to bee
Page  [unnumbered]
done, and the Apostle forbiddyng it would not haue sayd, I say, not the Lord. For if the man be per∣mitted to bee separated from his wyfe for the cause of fornicatiō: howe muche more ought the mā to detest and abhorre in his wyfe the fornication of the mynde, that is to say, infidelitie, of the which it is written:* Because loo they that make them selues farre from the, shall perishe. Thou hast de∣stroyed euery one that hath gone by fornication from thee.

But because it is after that sorte lawfull,* that it is not expe∣dient, least menne beyng offended for the separation of their wyfes, should abhorre the doctrine of sal¦uacion, by whiche vnlauful thin∣ges be prohibited, and so remain worse & worse in their infidelitie
Page  [unnumbered]
to their owne damnacion: Ther∣fore the Apostle is an intercessor, and by admonishment forbiddeth to be done, that is lawfull in that sorte that it is not expedient. For christen men and women be euen in lyke sorte not forbydden of the Lorde to go from their infidele wyfes and husbandes, as they be not cōmaunded. For if they were commaunded to put away suche wyues & husbandes: than there should be no place left to ye coun∣sail of the Apostle that admoni∣sheth ye thyng should not be done. For a good seruant would by no meanes forbid a thing to be done that the Lord cōmaundeth. For the Lorde ones by Esdras the prophet cōmaunded it to be done,* and it was done. The Israelites all that than had any, put away
Page  [unnumbered]
their wyfes that wer straungers borne of another stocke, by which wyfes the men were seduced and led to straunge goddes, and not the women were won & brought to ye true god by their husbādes. For as yet the great grace of our sauiour did not shyne, & the mul∣titude of that people didgape and looke for the temporal promises of the olde testament. And ther∣fore when they sawe those men also that worshypped many false gods abound in worldly goodes whiche they looked for at the Lordes hand as a great reward, by the flattery of their wyues. First they were afrayde to offend those false goddes, and afterward were induced to worship theim. Wherfore the Lorde cōmaunded by the holy man Moyses, that no
Page  [unnumbered]
mā should marry a wyfe beyng a straūger born. Therfore by good right they did put away at ye lor∣des cōmaundement, those wyues they maried against the Lordes commaundement. But when the gospel begā to be preached to the Gentyles it found one Gētile ma∣ryed to another, of whom if both the parties dyd not receiue the fayth, but the man or the woman beyng an infidele dyd consent to dwel with the other parte beyng christened: Neither the ← christian → ought to be prohibited of ye lorde to put away the infidele, nor yet to be cōmaunded. For she ought not to bee prohibited, because iu∣stice suffereth to go away from a fornicator, & an infidele mā hath in his harte the greater fornica∣tion: nor his chastitee with his
Page  [unnumbered]
wyfe can not bee called true, be∣cause whatsoeuer is not of fayth is synne, although a christiā wo∣mā may haue true chastitie with an infidele husband that hath no true chastitie. Therfore the chri∣stians ought not to be commaun∣ded to be separated frō infideles, because they were bothe maryed beyng Gentiles, not against the commaundement of the Lorde. Seyng than ye Lord neither for∣byddeth nor commaundeth the ← christian → to go from the infidele: Therfore, that the christiā shuld not go away, not the Lord, but the Apostle sayth, hauyng the holy ghost in whom he is able to geue fruitful and faythfull coun∣sail. Wherfore when he had sayd of the womā whose husbād was dead, she shal be more happi, if she
Page  [unnumbered]
remaine so, after my counsail: lest any man might thynke this to be contemned as mannes counsail & not as Goddes, he added after, I thynke verely that I haue the spirit of God. We must therfore vnderstand that the thinges that be not cōmaunded of the Lorde, but be fruitfully coūsailed of his seruaunt, be counsailed by the in∣spiration of the same Lord. God forbyd that any Catholike man say, when the holy ghost dothe counsail, that the Lord doth not counsail: seyng that he also is the Lord, & the workes of the Trini¦tie be inseparable. Yet he sayth, (concernyng virgynes I haue no cōmaundement of the Lord,* but geue counsail, not that we shuld thynke this counsail came not of the Lorde, seyng it foloweth by
Page  [unnumbered]
and by, and he sayth. As hauyng obtained mercy of the Lord to be a faythfull counsailor. By God therfore he geueth a faythful coū¦sail in ye spirit of whō he sayth. I thinke that I also haue ye spirit of God. Notwithstandyng the cō¦maundement of the Lord is one thyng, and the faythfull counsail of the seruaunt accordyng to the mercyful gyft of charitee whiche is inspired & geuen to him of the Lord, is another thyng. There to doo otherwyse is not lawfull, here it is lawful, but so that the thyng lauful, is partly expedient, partly not expedient. It is than expedient, when not only by righ¦teousnes before god it is permit∣ted, but also when men receiue of it no impediment to saluation: al∣though to do otherwise, (that is
Page  [unnumbered]
to say, to marry and embrace ma∣riage whiche is good, but lesse than continency) is both lawful & expedient. Because it so releueth by the honesty of mariage the in∣firmitie of ye fleshe whiche is euer prone to fal to al vnlawful thyn∣ges, that it stoppeth no man from saluacion, although it wer more expedient & more honest, if a vir∣gyn would take that counsail, whervnto ye cōmaundement doth not cōpel her. Than also a lauful thyng is not expedient, when it is permitted, but the vse of that libertie and power, bryngeth to other an impediment of saluaciō. Of this sort is (wherof we haue spoken long) the departyng of a ← christian → man or wife from an in∣fidele, whiche the Lord forbyd∣deth not by commaundement of
Page  [unnumbered]
lawe, bycause it is not vniust be∣fore hym: but the Apostle forbid∣deth it by the counsel of charytie bicause it is to the infidels an im∣pediment of saluacion, not onely for that they be very perniciously offended: but also for that when they fall and ioyne theim selues in other maryages their wyues beyng alyue that put them away before, than they be with muche difficultie loosed and pulled from suche adulterouse maryages, as they be bounden vnto.

Therefore here where that is lawefull is not expedyent,* it may not bee sayd, yf she putte awaye the infidell, she dothe well, yf she put him not awaye, she doth bet∣ter: as it is sayd, he that gyueth to maryage doth wel, and he that dothe not gyue to maryage dothe
Page  [unnumbered]
better. For in that second part not onely both be lawfull, & therfore to neither of them any manne is compelled by Gods commaunde∣ment: but also both be expedient, the one lesse, ye other more, wher∣fore to that is more expedient, by the Apostles counsell euery man that may is prouoked to take it. But this where the questyon is concernynge the puttynge away or not puttyng awaye of the in∣fideles wyfe or husband? both be lyke laweful by that ryghtwyse∣nes whiche is before God, and therefore the Lorde forbyddeth neyther of them: but yet both be not expedient for the infyrmities of men, and therfore the Apostle forbiddeth that is not expedient, the Lord geuyng him free liber∣tie to forbyd, for neither that the
