another question of them that be alredi ioyned, let the Apostle here also be hard saiēg, if any brother haue an infidel to his wife, and if she consent to dwel with him, let him not put her away: and if any woman haue an infidel to her hus¦bande and if he consent to dwell with her, let her not put hī away And let hym be herde so, that al∣thoughe it is lawful to be done, bicause the lorde saith it not: yet let it not be done, bicause it is not expediente. For the Apostle as I haue shewed before most plainly tetheth, that al thinges be not ex¦pedient that be lawful. So that for euery kind of fornicacion, ey∣ther of the fleshe, or of the spirite (where also infydelitye is vnder∣standed) both it is not lauful for a woman, putting awaye her hus∣band to marry an other man, and
Page  [unnumbered]
also it is not lauful for a mā put∣tyng away his wyfe to marry an other, because the lord saith with out any exceptiō. If a wyfe put a¦wai her husband and ← marrieth an other,* she commytteth adulterye. And euery mā that putteth away his wyfe and marieth another, cō∣mitteth adultery. These thinges after the mesure of my talent, be∣ing thus intreated and discussed: yet I am not ignorant but that the question cōcernyng mariages is verye darke and intricate and hard to make plaine. Nor I dare not profeffe that I haue as yet vnfolded either in this worke or in any other, or that I nowe can (yf I be pressed vpon) explicate al the secrete corners of it. As for that you thought good lykewyse to consult and aske my mynde in an other letter, I wolde haue de∣clared
Page  [unnumbered]
it apart by it selfe, if I had thought otherwise of it then you do. But seing our mindes and opi¦nions cōcerning that be both one, it is not nedefull to dyspute of it here any lenger.

They that be as yet vnchry∣stened and lerning the cathechys∣me, being at the point of death,* if by sicknes or by any chāce thei be so oppressed, that althoughe they yet liue, yet they can not for thē selfes aske baptisme, or answere to the interrogatories of theyr faith: ther wyl which in Christes faith is manifestly knowen, may profyt them so, that they may be baptised after yt sort as infantes be baptized, whose wyll as yet doth not apere at al. And yet we may not therfore condēne those yt be in that thing more ferefull thē we thinke they ought to be, least
Page  [unnumbered]
men thinke by vs that we woldē iudge of the talent committed to our felowe seruant rather nough¦tely then warely. For in such mat¦ters we must consydre what the Apostle saythe.* Euery one of vs shal giue accompt for hī self, ther¦fore let vs no more one iudge an other. There be that thinke, that both in this and in other thinges we must obserue, that we reade ye Lord sayd.* Do not geue an holy thing to dogges, nor cast not pre¦cyous stones before hogges, and rehersinge these our Sauioures wordes, dare not baptize those yt can not aunswere for them selfe, least peraduenture they haue a cō¦trary wil, which can not be spokē of infantes, in whom as yet there is no vse of reson. And it is not on¦ly vncredible that this mā which is vnchristened and lerninge his
Page  [unnumbered]
Cathechisme, wold not be bapty∣sed in the end of his lyfe: but also if his wyl were vnknowen, it is better to geue baptism to hī that wil not, thē to deny it to him that wyl, where it appereth not whe∣ther he willeth it or refuseth it, & yet it is more credible yt he would rather say if he could, yt he would receiue those Sacramentes, with¦out which he beleued nowe that he ought not to departe out of this body.

If the Lorde where he saithe, giue not an holy thing to dogges wold haue that vnderstāded,* that these men thinke they oughte to beware of, he wold neuer hī selfe haue gyuen to his betrayer, that whiche he vnworthy receiued wt other beīg worthy, to his destru∣ction without any faut of the gi∣uer. Wherefore we must beleue yt
Page  [unnumbered]
the Lord would declare by yt his saiyng, that vnclene hartes beare not the light of spiritual vnderstā¦ding. And if the doctor do preche and put into their heades, what doctrin thei ougbt to bere, which they doo not take right: because they take it not, either they bite & rent it by reprehending it, or els they tread it vnderfoote by contē¦ning it.* For if the blessed Apostle say, that he gaue mylke and not stronge meate to those that were borne againe and yet but childrē in Christ? for (saith he) as yet ye coulde not, nor euen nowe ye can not take it. And if the Lorde hym self said to his elect Apostles,* yet I haue many thynges to saye to you, but you can not beare theim now: how much lesse can the vn∣cleane myndes of wycked men do al thynges that be spoken of the
Page  [unnumbered]
heauenlye and incorporall lyght.

But to make an ende of my dis∣putaciō in the same matter it be∣gan in,* I thinke that not onely ye vnchristened lerners of our faith, but also they that be coupled and liue stil in adulterouse mariages, althoughe we do not admit them to baptisme: being in good health of bodye, and remaininge styll in their adultery, yet if they lye in desperacion of lyfe, and be peny∣tente within them selfes, and can not answere for them selfes: I thinke they ought to be baptized that this syn may also with the rest be wasshed awaye by the la∣uer of regeneracyon. For who knoweth whether perchāce they had purposed to reteine styll the adulterouse pleasure and prouo∣cacyon of the fleshe euen to bap∣tisme or no? But if they may re∣couer
Page  [unnumbered]
the health from that despe∣racyon they were in and lyue: ey∣ther they wyll do that they pur∣posed, or they wyll obey as they be taught, or els yf they bee con∣temners, it shalbe done to theim, as it oughte to be doone to suche naughty Christened men. More∣ouer that whiche is the cause of Baptysme, the same is the cause of reconciliacion, if by any chance the peryl of death do preuent the penytent. For our mother the churche ought not to wyl theim to depart out of this lyfe, without the pledge of their peace.

¶ Thus endeth the first boke.

¶The second Booke.

FOR aunswere to these thynges you wrote to me of be∣fore,* Christen bro¦ther Pollentius, I haue now writē agayn no smalle, volume, concer∣nynge those yt hauing theyr own wifes or husbandes aliue, yet be coupled and maryed vnto other. Wich thyng when it was knowē vnto you, you dyd adde certayne other maters to your boke, desirīg me to make answer to those also, but when I was about to doo so, and to adde likewise to my boke, so that ther shuld be but one boke of myne answer: sodenly my for∣mer booke as soon as I had fini∣shed it, it was published, at the re∣queste of our brethren, and not
Page  [unnumbered]
knowing yt any thinge was more to be added vnto it, for that cause I am compelled to make answer in any other booke by it selfe to those thynges whiche you added. And those your additions be not ioyned to ye end of your booke, but are put & interlaced wher it plea∣sed you in the body of your boke.

*The firste of them wherunto I thynke I must make answer, is that in these wordes of the A∣postle wher he saythe. (But to the other, I say, not our Lorde, that the wyfe doo not forsake and goo from her husband, but yf she goo from hym, then to remayn vnmaryed, or els to be reconcyled again to her husband) your opi∣nion is, that it is not so spoken of S. P. (yf she goo away) that it shuld be vnderstāded of her goīg
Page  [unnumbered]
awaye from her husband cōmyt∣tynge adultery, for whiche onely cause it is lawfull to make de∣uorse: but rather you thynke that she is therfore commaunded to lyue vnmaried that she myght be reconciled to her husband, in case he will not lyue continently, leaste she beyng not reconciled, myght so bryng her husband to fornica∣cion, that is to say, to marye an o∣ther she beyng alyue. Moreouer yf she goo from her husbande for fornicacion, then you thynke that she is not cōmaundyd to remaine vnmaried, but yt she dothe it, be∣cause she wyll lyue continētly, not that she shuld be taken as brekīg the commaundement, yf she be af∣terward maryed. Whiche forme also you thynke ought to be ob∣serued of the husband lykewyse,
Page  [unnumbered]
yt he doo not put away hys wyfe, excepte it be for fornication, but yf he put her away, that he remayne wythout maryage, that he myght afterwarde be reconcyled to hys chaste wyfe, excepte she by chaūce haue chosen continencye, leaste he refusynge to be reconcyled to hys chaste wife, myght compell her to commyt adultery, yf she forbea∣ryng to lyue sole chaūce to be ma∣ryed to an other, during her firste husbandes lyfe. But yf he be de∣uorsed from hys wyfe for fornica∣tion, than you thynke, he is bown∣den by no commaundemēt, to liue vnmaryed, and that he cōmytteth no adultery, yf she beynge alyue, he doo marie an other, because the saing of the same Apostle S. paul (the woman is bownden so longe
Page  [unnumbered]
as her husband lyueth, but yf her husband be dead, she is deliuered frō that bond, to marye whom she wyll,) you thynke yt ought so to be vnderstanded, that yf the hus∣band commit adultery, he shulde be takē for dead, and also the wife for dead, & therfor yt it is lawfull for eyther of thē, as after deathe, euen so after fornication of eyther parte to be maried to an other.

Now hauynge considered these your vnderstādīges,* I demaūde and aske vpon you, whether he yt shall marye a woman, that is de∣liuered from the bonde of matry∣monye with her husbande, is to be counted an adulterour or no? I suppose you thynke hym to be noon. For therfor a womā during her husbandes lyfe, shall be called an adultresse, yf she be wt an other
Page  [unnumbered]
man: because she is bownden so longe as her husband lyuethe, And yf thys bonde wer dissolued her husbande beynge alyue: than without any cryme of adultery she myght be maried to an other man. But yf she be bownden so longe as her husbāde liuethe: thē by no meanes she may be called free from that bonde, but by the death of her husbande. Further yf thys bonde betwen the man and the wyfe be brokē and lowsed by the deathe of eyther party, and (as you say) yf fornicatiō be counted for deathe: then wythout dowt a woman shal be deliuered from yt bond betwen her & her husbande, whensoeuer she shall commit for∣nication. For it can not be sayd yt she is bownden to her husbande, & yf any man doo marie her, he shal
Page  [unnumbered]
be no adulterour.

But marke what a great ab∣surditie it is,* that therfore the mā is no adulterour because he ma∣ryethe an adultresse. Yea also (whiche thīg is more mōstruouse) the woman her selfe that commit∣teth adultery, shal not be called an adultresse, bebause she shall be to the second man, not an other mās wyfe, but hys own wyfe. For whē the former bond of matrimonie is brokē by adultrye, to whatsoeuer man not hauynge a wyfe, she shal be maried, she shal not be an adul¦tresse wyth an adulterour, but ra∣ther a wyfe with her husbande. Then howe can it be true, that a woman is bownden so longe as her husbande liuethe? Behold her husband liueth, because he is ney∣ther departed oute of his body,
Page  [unnumbered]
nor yet hathe committed fornica∣tion, (which you wold haue repu∣ted for deathe): and yet the womā is nowe no more bownden vnto hym. Doo you not marke howe directly this is agaīste ye Apostle, saiynge, a woman is bownden so long as her husbande lyuethe? or wyl you perchaūce say, that he ly∣uethe, but yet he is not her hus∣band? for than he ceased to be her husbande, when she, by adulterye, dissolued the bond of mariage. Than howe shall she duringe her husbandes lyfe, be called an adul¦tresse, yf she be wyth an other mā, seying that her husbād is not now her husband, the bond of matry∣monie beying dissolued by the wo¦mās adultery? For duryng which husbandes lyfe, shall she be called an adultresse, yf she be with an o∣ther
Page  [unnumbered]
man but her own husbande? But yf he cease to be her husbād, than truely she shall not be called an adultresse duringe her husbā∣des lyfe, yf she be wyth an other man but hauinge no husband she may be maryed to her own hus∣bād. He that is of thys minde, doo you not see how moch he thinketh agaīst ye Apostles minde? Which thing is not your opiniō, but this folowethe your opiniō. Chaunge therfor the antecedēt, yf ye wil be∣ware & auoid ye cōsequēt. And say not yt the dead man or dead wife, may in this place be vnderstāded for the man or wife cōmittinge a∣dultery. Wherfor after ye holsom doctrine & teachinge, the womā is bownden so longe as her husbād lyuethe yt is to say, is not departed oute of hys body. For a woman maried
