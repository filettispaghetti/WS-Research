
"Who sees his truelove in her naked bed,
Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,
But when his glutton eye so full hath fed,
His other agents aim at like delight?
  Who is so faint that dares not be so bold
  To touch the fire, the weather being cold?

"Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy,
And learn of him, I heartily beseech thee,
To take advantage on presented joy;
Though I were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee.
  O, learn to love; the lesson is but plain
  And, once made perfect, never lost again."

"I know not love," quoth he, "nor will not know it,
Unless it be a boar, and then I chase it.
'Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it.
My love to love is love but to disgrace it,
  For I have heard it is a life in death
  That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath.

"Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinished?
Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?
If springing things be any jot diminished,
They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth.
  The colt that's backed and burdened being young
  Loseth his pride and never waxeth strong.

"You hurt my hand with wringing. Let us part,
And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat.
Remove your siege from my unyielding heart;
To love's alarms it will not ope the gate.
  Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flatt'ry,
  For where a heart is hard, they make no batt'ry."

"What, canst thou talk?" quoth she. "Hast thou a tongue?
O, would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing!
Thy mermaid's voice hath done me double wrong;
I had my load before, now pressed with bearing:
  Melodious discord, heavenly tune harsh sounding,
  Ears' deep sweet music, and heart's deep sore wounding.

"Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love
That inward beauty and invisible.
Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move
Each part in me that were but sensible.
  Though neither eyes, nor ears, to hear nor see,
  Yet should I be in love by touching thee.
