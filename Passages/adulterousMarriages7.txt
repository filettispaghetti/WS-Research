be of the Apostles mind, that we say not, a man committing adul∣tery, is to be counted as a dead man, and yt therfor it is lawful for his wife to marye an other man. For although adulterie be death, not of ye bodye, but of the soule, whiche is worse: yet the Apostle spake not of that deathe, when he sayd, yf her husband be dead, she may marie to whom she will: but of that onely deathe wherby a mā departeth oute of his bodye. For yf by the mans adulterie, the bōd of matrimonye be dissolued: than foloweth that absurditie, which I tolde before ought to be auoided, that the wife also by her fornica∣tion, shuld be loosed from ye bond, & yf she be loosed, she is free from the law of her husband, and ther∣for (which thing is moste foulish∣ly
Page  [unnumbered]
spokē) she shall be no adultresse yf she be with an other man, be∣cause by her own adultery she is departed frō her former husband. Which thinge yf it be so far wide of truthe, yt no man, (I speake not onely of Christianes,) but no com¦men wit will admit it: than truely the womā is bownden so long as her husband liueth, and to speake more plainly, so long as her hus∣band is in his bodye. And after lyke forme and maner, the husbād is bownden, so longe as ye womā lyuethe, in her bodye. For whiche cause, yf he wil put away the adul¦tresse, let hym not marye an other womā, leste he him selfe doo cōmit yt he blameth in his wif. Likewise yf the woman put hym awaye, let her not couple her selfe to an o∣ther, for she is bownden so longe
Page  [unnumbered]
as her husband lyueth nor she is not delyuered from the law of her husbande (except he be dead) that she be no adulteresse, if she be with on other man.

And wher as it is thought hard to you,* that after adoulterye the one partye shulde be reconciled to ye other: it shal not be herd yf faith be present. For why shulde we re∣ken them as yete adulteroures, whome we beleue be eyther was∣shed bi baptisme, or healed by pe∣naunce? Thes crimes in the olde lawe of God wer purged by no sa¦crifyces, which by the bloud of the new testamēt without any dowbte are purged, & therfore than it was prohibyte all to gyther to take a∣gayne hys wyfe, after shee hade been defyled by an other man: al∣thoughe Dauid as beynge a pre∣figurer
Page  [unnumbered]
of the new testamēt with∣out any delaye tooke agayne the dowgther of Saul which her fa∣ther had separated from Dauid & gyuen to an other. But nowe af∣ter that Christe hathe sayd to the woman taken in adulterye? And I also wil not condemne the go thy ways, synne no more here∣after: who vnderstādeth not that the husbande owghte to forgyue, that he seeth ye Lord of them both dyd forgyue, and that he oughte not now to call her an adulteresse whose crime at her penance, he be∣leueth is forgiuen by the mercy∣fulnes of God.

But the vnfaythfull mens vn∣derstanding abhorreth thys,* in so moch that some hauing litle faith or rather beynge enemyes of true faithe, fearing as I suppose, that
Page  [unnumbered]
libertye to synne without punishe¦mēt is giuen to their wyfes, wold pul out of ther bokes that which the Lorde dyd, in pardonyng the womā takē in adulteri: as though he had permytted and giuen liber¦tye to synne, that said, syn no more herafter: or els that the woman ought not to be made hole of god the phisyciane, by the remission of that synne, lest they being infected & not wholle myght be offended: For these men that be displeasede with thys fact of the Lord be not them selfes chaste: nor yet chastitie dothe not make them so seuere & extreme: but rather they be of that numbre of men, to whom the lord said, which so euer of you is with out synne, let him first cast a stone agaynste her, sauyng that they a∣frayed bi their own cōsciēces went
Page  [unnumbered]
away, & ceased to rempte Christe, or to persue the adultresse: but these, bothe beyng sicke thē selfes, reprehend the Phisicyane, & also beynge adulterours be cruell a∣gainst women committing adul∣terie: to whom yf it wer saide, not as it was to the Iewes, he that is without synne, (for who is wyth∣out sinne?) but he that is without this sinne, let him first cast a stone against her: than perchaunce, they that wer greued for not kyllynge the adulterouse woman wold con¦sider, with what great mercy of god they them selfes wer spared and fauored, that beynge adulte∣rours yet wer alyue.

When we say these thynges to them,* not onely they wyll remyt nothinge of ther seueritie, but be more ouer angrie at ye veritie and
Page  [unnumbered]
truthe it selfe, and speake and an∣swer thus: but we be men. Shall the dignitie of our kynde beynge men, susteyn thys iniurie, that we shulde be compared to women in sufferynge of punishment, yf we commit any fornicatiō with other women besyde oure wiues? As though they ought not therfore the more to refreyn lyke men theyr vnlawfull desires and lustes, be∣cause they be men: as though they ought not therfore the more, to gyue them selfes as examples of thys vertue to ther wifes, because they be menne: as though they ought not therfore the lesse to be ouercommed with filthy pleasure, because they be men: as thoughe they ought not therfore the lesse to serue the wātones of the fleshe, because they be men. And yet they
Page  [unnumbered]
be angrie yf they heare that adul∣terouse men doo suffre lyke pu∣nyshment wyth adulterouse wo∣men, saynge they ought to be punished so moche the more gre∣uously, as it perteynethe more to them, bothe to ouercom women in vertue, and to rule them by exam∣ple. I speake to Chrystē men, that with faithe heare thys saiyng, the man is the head of the woman: wher thei knowlege yt thei ought to be the guydes, and the women to be the folowers. And therfore the man muste beware that he go not that way by thys lyuinge that he fearethe, hys wyfe wyll go by folowynge.

But they that be displeased, that lyke forme of chastytie be kepte betwen man and wyfe, and chose rather (specially in thys matier)
Page  [unnumbered]
to be vnder the lawes of ye world, than of Christe, because the ciuill lawes of the world seme to bynde men not with the same bondes of chastitie, that they bynd women: let them read what Antonius the Emperour, whiche was no Chry∣sten man, dyd constitute and or∣deyn concernynge thys matier, wher the husbande is not suffred to accuse the wife for the cryme of adulterie, to whom he hathe not in hys liuinge gyuen example of chastitie, so that bothe shulde be condemned yf that contention did proue them bothe alyke to haue been vnchaste. For the foresayd Emperours wordes wryten to Gregorianus, be these. My let∣ters, saythe he, shall in no parte of the cause be any preiudice. For yf
Page  [unnumbered]
the fawlt be in you, yt the mariage be dissolued, and yf your wife Eu∣pasia doo marie accordynge to the lawe of Iulius, she shall not be condemned of adulterye for my wrytynge, excepte it appere and be proued that she hath doon adulterye. They shal haue before their eyes authorytie to inquyre, whether you lyuynge chastely, haue been author for her to lyue likewise well and chastely or no? For it semethe to me very vn∣right, that the man shulde re∣quire chastitie of hys wife, whiche he hym selfe wyll not performe: which thing may bothe condemne the man, and for mutuall re∣compence of bothe their crymes, make an end of the matier betwen them both, or els take away the
Page  [unnumbered]
cause of the facte. Yf these be to be obserued for the comlynes of the earthly citie, howe moche more chaste doth the heauenly citie and the feloshyppe of angels require men to be. Seyng these thynges be thus, is the vncleanes of men therfore the lesse, and not rather more and worse, because in them there is a certayne proude and licentyouse boastinge? Lette not therfore men abhorre that Christe forgaue the adulterouse woman, but rather let them knowe their owne perill, and beynge infected wyth the same sickenes, lette them flee with deuout supplication to the same Sauioure, and lette them confesse it to be necessarie to them, that they read was doon in her, let them receiue the medy∣cyne of their adulteryes, and cease
Page  [unnumbered]
to cōmyt any more adulteryes, let them prayse the pacience of God in them, let them doo penaunce, and receyue pardon, and finally let them change ther opinion con∣cerning the punishment of womē, and the impunitie of them selfes.

Whyche thynges consydered and intreated,* yf the commen con∣condicion betwene man and wife, the commen harme, the cōmen pe∣ryll, the commen wound, the com∣men health & saftye, be faithfully and humbly thought vpō: the re∣concylinge of them bothe, after adulteries commytted and pur∣ged, shal not be honeste nor harde, where men doubt not but remis∣sion of synne is made by the keyes of the kyngdome of heauen, not that after deuorse frō her husbād
Page  [unnumbered]
the adultresse shulde be called home agayne: but that after fe∣lowshyppe without Christe, she shulde be called no more an adul∣tresse. But beholde (some wyll say) it ought not to be doone whiche noman compelleth, be∣cause peraduenture some lawe of thys worlde after the maner of ye earthly citie forbiddeth it, wher the remission and abolishinge of sinne by the holy bloud of Christe is not thought vpon. Than let continency be taken, whiche no lawe forbyddethe, and let no mo new adulteries be committed. And what is that to vs, yf ye adul∣terouse wife being at lest purged and made clene by the mercy of god be not reconciled to her hus∣band, so that whyles they be vn∣reconcyled, no other maryages
Page  [unnumbered]
be made as lawfull matrimonye, whiche are proued to be adulte∣ries? For the woman is bounden so long as her husbande liueth, & so consequently the man is boun∣den so longe as his wyfe lyuethe. Thys byndyng causeth that they can not be ioyned with other with∣out adulterouse copulation, wher vpon it foloweth necessarily that of two maryed persons are made fowre adulterers, yf she marye an other man and he marye an other woman. For althoughe he com∣mytteth more wycked adulterye that puttinge away hys wyfe not for fornication, maryeth an other, whiche kynde of adulterye Saint Matthewe made mention vpon: yet not only he cōmitteth adultery and as Luke sayth, euery mā that puttethe away hys wife & marieth
Page  [unnumbered]
an other, cōmitteth adultery. Of whiche testimonies I haue dispu∣ted ynowgh in my former booke.

But you answer me that to liue continently is gyuen to fewe men and therfore they that haue put a∣way their wifes for fornication,* be¦cause they can not be reconcyled, thei see thē selfes to be in so great daūger, that they pronounce chri∣stes lawe not to be mercyfull and gentle, but beastely and cruell. O brother, mē that lyue not continēt¦li for as moch as perteineth to thē may haue many cōplaintes wher∣by (as you sai) to pronoūce Chri∣stes law to be cruel & not merciful & yet we ought not for their cause to peruerte & chaūge the gospel of Christe. You are moued onely by their cōplaint, that put away their wifes for fornication, & be not suf∣fred
Page  [unnumbered]
to mari other: because to liue continently is giuen to few men, & to it, men ought to be exhorted by prayse, not compelled by law. And so if when an adulteresse is put a∣way, an other wyfe may not be ma¦ried: the incontinencie of men shal haue (as you thinke) a iuste com∣plainte. But marke howe many thynges ther be where yf we wyll not admyt the complayntes of mē not lyuing continently, we muste nedes permytte adulteryes to be doon. For what and yf the wyfe be holden with a longe and incu∣rable sicknes of the body, so that carnall copulation islet? What & if captiuitie or some other violēce, do separate ye one frō the other so yt the mā knoweth his wyfe is aliue & yet can not inioy her: thinke you yt we ought to admit ye grudgyng
Page  [unnumbered]
of incontinent men, and to permyt adulteries? What thynke you in that same wherin the Lorde was asked the question, and answered that it ought not to be doon, but that Moyses for the hardenes of their harte dyd permytte a libel of deuorse to be giuen, and for euery cause to put away the wyfe. Doth not Christes law displease the in∣continent liuers, that wyll by a di¦uorse reiecte and put away theyr wifes that be chyding, contētiouse iniuriouse, proud and disdainful to pay their carnal debte, and ma∣rie other? Now because the incon∣tinent lyfe of these men abhorreth the lawe of Christe, therfore must Christes law be changed to theyr wyll. Moreouer if a wyfe forsake her husbande, or a man hys wife, not for fornication but rather for
Page  [unnumbered]
this intent to lyue in continencye, and yet is an incontinent liuer, to whom for that cause is giuen a li∣bell of diuorse: I aske the questiō whether shal not he or she be adul¦terours, yf eyther of them be cou∣pled in mariage to any other? Yf it be sayd, they shall not be. than it is sayd againste the Lorde, whose wordes be these, who soeuer put∣teth away his wife except the cause of fornication,* causeth her to com∣mit adulterie, and he that marieth her that is put away, is an adulte¦rour. Beholde she is put away, & puttethe not her husbāde awaye, and because to lyue continently is giuen to a fewe, she gaue place to incontinencie, and toke an hus∣bande, and yet an adulterour ma∣ried an adulteresse. Bothe be gil∣tie bothe are to be cōdemned, both
Page  [unnumbered]
she that was maried her husband beinge alyue, and he that maried her, that had an husbande alyue. Doe we here call Christes lawe vnmercyfull, wherby she is made giltye of so great a cryme, and is punyshed, whom her husband put away, without any former fornica¦tion of her parte, & because to liue continently is giuen to few, in put¦ting her away he compelled her to mari? Why doe we not here say, that the man is to be cownted as dead, that by puttīg her wrongful¦li away, brake first the bond of ma¦trimony? For by what reason will you saie, that he brake the bond of matrimonie, that althowgh he be an adulterour, dyd not put away his wife, & that he brake the bond of matrimonie, that did put away his wife beīg chast? but I sai that
