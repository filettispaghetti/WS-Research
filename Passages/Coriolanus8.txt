MARCIUS
Here: what's the matter?
Messenger
The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.
MARCIUS
I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent
Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.
Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators; JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS

First Senator
Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;
The Volsces are in arms.
MARCIUS
They have a leader,
Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.
I sin in envying his nobility,
And were I any thing but what I am,
I would wish me only he.
COMINIUS
You have fought together.
MARCIUS
Were half to half the world by the ears and he.
Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
Only my wars with him: he is a lion
That I am proud to hunt.
First Senator
Then, worthy Marcius,
Attend upon Cominius to these wars.
COMINIUS
It is your former promise.
MARCIUS
Sir, it is;
And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?
TITUS
No, Caius Marcius;
I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,
Ere stay behind this business.
MENENIUS
O, true-bred!
First Senator
Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,
Our greatest friends attend us.
TITUS
[To COMINIUS] Lead you on.
To MARCIUS

Right worthy you priority.
COMINIUS
