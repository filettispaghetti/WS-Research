Lmightie God, giuer of all good things, which by thy holy ƒpi- rit ha¥ appointed divers orders of Mini¥ers in thy Church, mercifully behold this thy seruant, now called to the wo°ke and
mini¥ery of a Biƒhop, and repleniƒh him ƒo with the truth of thy
doctrine, and innocencie of life, that both by wo°d and deed he may faithfully serue thee in this office, to the glo°y of thy Name, and
profit of thy Congregation, through the merits of our Sauiour
Jeƒus Ch°i¥, who liueth and reigneth with thee and the holy Gho¥, wo°ld without end. Amen.

Then the Archbiſhop ſitting in a chaire, ſhall ſay to him that is to bee conſecrated.

Rother, fo° as much as holy Scripture, and the old Canons
commandeth, that we ƒhould not be ha¥y in laying on hands, and admitting of any perƒon to the gouernement of the Congregation
of Ch°i¥, which he hath purchaƒed with no le±e p°ice than the
effuƒion of his owne blood: afo°e I admit you to this admini¥ration
wherunto you are called, I will examine you in certaine articles, to
the end the Congregation present, may haue a triall and beare witne±e
how ye be minded to behaue your ƒelfe in the Church of God.
 Are you perƒwaded that you bee truly called to this mini¥ration
according to the will of our Lo°de Jeƒus Chri¥, and the o°der of
this Realme?
Anſwere.
I am ƒo perƒwaded.
The Archbiſhop.
Re you perƒwaded that the holy Scriptures containe ƒuffici- ently all doctrine, required of nece±itie fo° eternall ƒaluation, th°ough the faith in Jeƒus Ch°i¥? And are you determined with the
ƒame holy Scriptures, to in¥ruct the people committed to your
A
B
A
charge, and to teach o° maintaine nothing, as required of nece±itie
to eternall saluation, but that you ƒhall be perƒwaded may be concluded, and p°oued by the ƒame?
Anſwere.
I am so perƒwaded and determined by Gods grace.
The Archbiſhop.
Ill you then faithfully exerciƒe your ƒelfe in the ƒayd holy
Scriptures, and call vpon God by p°ayer fo° the true un- der¥anding of the ƒame, ƒo as ye may be able by them to teache and
exho°t with wholeƒome doctrine, and to with¥and and conuince the
gaineƒayers?
Anſwere.
I will so doe, by the helpe of God.
The Archbiſhop.
E you ready with all faithfull diligence to baniƒh and d°iue away
all erroneous and ¥range doctrine contrary to Gods wo°d, and both p°iuately and openly to call vpon, and encourage
other to the ƒame?
Anſwere.
I am ready, the Lo°d being my helper.
The Archbiſhop.
Ill you deny all vngodline±e and wo°ldly lu¥s, and liue
ƒoberly, righteously, and godly in this wo°ld, that you may ƒhewe your ƒelfe in all things an example of good wo°ks vnto other,
that the aduerƒary may be aƒhamed, hauing nothing to lay again¥
you?
Anſwere.
I will so doe, the Lo°d being my helper.
