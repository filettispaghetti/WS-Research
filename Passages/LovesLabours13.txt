carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back
like a porter: and he was in love.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do
excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in
carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's
love, my dear Moth?
MOTH
A woman, master.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Of what complexion?
MOTH
Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Tell me precisely of what complexion.
MOTH
Of the sea-water green, sir.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Is that one of the four complexions?
MOTH
As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a
love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason
for it. He surely affected her for her wit.
MOTH
It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
My love is most immaculate white and red.
MOTH
Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under
such colours.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Define, define, well-educated infant.
MOTH
My father's wit and my mother's tongue, assist me!
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty and
pathetical!
MOTH
If she be made of white and red,
Her faults will ne'er be known,
