TIMON
You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,
Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,
Which was not half so beautiful and kind;
You have added worth unto 't and lustre,
And entertain'd me with mine own device;
I am to thank you for 't.
First Lady
My lord, you take us even at the best.
APEMANTUS
'Faith, for the worst is filthy; and would not hold
taking, I doubt me.
TIMON
Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you:
Please you to dispose yourselves.
All Ladies
Most thankfully, my lord.
Exeunt Cupid and Ladies

TIMON
Flavius.
FLAVIUS
My lord?
TIMON
The little casket bring me hither.
FLAVIUS
Yes, my lord. More jewels yet!
There is no crossing him in 's humour;
Aside

Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
When all's spent, he 'ld be cross'd then, an he could.
'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,
That man might ne'er be wretched for his mind.
Exit

First Lord
Where be our men?
Servant
Here, my lord, in readiness.
Second Lord
Our horses!
Re-enter FLAVIUS, with the casket

TIMON
O my friends,
I have one word to say to you: look you, my good lord,
I must entreat you, honour me so much
As to advance this jewel; accept it and wear it,
Kind my lord.
