MENELAUS
Good night, my lord.
HECTOR
Good night, sweet lord Menelaus.
THERSITES
Sweet draught: 'sweet' quoth 'a! sweet sink,
sweet sewer.
ACHILLES
Good night and welcome, both at once, to those
That go or tarry.
AGAMEMNON
Good night.
Exeunt AGAMEMNON and MENELAUS

ACHILLES
Old Nestor tarries; and you too, Diomed,
Keep Hector company an hour or two.
DIOMEDES
I cannot, lord; I have important business,
The tide whereof is now. Good night, great Hector.
HECTOR
Give me your hand.
ULYSSES
[Aside to TROILUS] Follow his torch; he goes to
Calchas' tent:
I'll keep you company.
TROILUS
Sweet sir, you honour me.
HECTOR
And so, good night.
Exit DIOMEDES; ULYSSES and TROILUS following

ACHILLES
Come, come, enter my tent.
Exeunt ACHILLES, HECTOR, AJAX, and NESTOR

THERSITES
That same Diomed's a false-hearted rogue, a most
unjust knave; I will no more trust him when he leers
than I will a serpent when he hisses: he will spend
his mouth, and promise, like Brabbler the hound:
but when he performs, astronomers foretell it; it
is prodigious, there will come some change; the sun
borrows of the moon, when Diomed keeps his
word. I will rather leave to see Hector, than
not to dog him: they say he keeps a Trojan
drab, and uses the traitor Calchas' tent: I'll
after. Nothing but lechery! all incontinent varlets!
Exit
