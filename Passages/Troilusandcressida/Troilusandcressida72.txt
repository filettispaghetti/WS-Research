In aspiration lifts him from the earth.
Enter DIOMEDES, with CRESSIDA

AGAMEMNON
Is this the Lady Cressid?
DIOMEDES
Even she.
AGAMEMNON
Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.
NESTOR
Our general doth salute you with a kiss.
ULYSSES
Yet is the kindness but particular;
'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.
NESTOR
And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.
So much for Nestor.
ACHILLES
I'll take what winter from your lips, fair lady:
Achilles bids you welcome.
MENELAUS
I had good argument for kissing once.
PATROCLUS
But that's no argument for kissing now;
For this popp'd Paris in his hardiment,
And parted thus you and your argument.
ULYSSES
O deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns!
For which we lose our heads to gild his horns.
PATROCLUS
The first was Menelaus' kiss; this, mine:
Patroclus kisses you.
MENELAUS
O, this is trim!
PATROCLUS
Paris and I kiss evermore for him.
MENELAUS
I'll have my kiss, sir. Lady, by your leave.
CRESSIDA
In kissing, do you render or receive?
PATROCLUS
Both take and give.
CRESSIDA
I'll make my match to live,
The kiss you take is better than you give;
Therefore no kiss.
MENELAUS
I'll give you boot, I'll give you three for one.
CRESSIDA
You're an odd man; give even or give none.
