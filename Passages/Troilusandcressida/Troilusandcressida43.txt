No, sir, Helen: could you not find out that by her
attributes?
PANDARUS
It should seem, fellow, that thou hast not seen the
Lady Cressida. I come to speak with Paris from the
Prince Troilus: I will make a complimental assault
upon him, for my business seethes.
Servant
Sodden business! there's a stewed phrase indeed!
Enter PARIS and HELEN, attended

PANDARUS
Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair
company! fair desires, in all fair measure,
fairly guide them! especially to you, fair queen!
fair thoughts be your fair pillow!
HELEN
Dear lord, you are full of fair words.
PANDARUS
You speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen. Fair
prince, here is good broken music.
PARIS
You have broke it, cousin: and, by my life, you
shall make it whole again; you shall piece it out
with a piece of your performance. Nell, he is full
of harmony.
PANDARUS
Truly, lady, no.
HELEN
O, sir,--
PANDARUS
Rude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.
PARIS
Well said, my lord! well, you say so in fits.
PANDARUS
I have business to my lord, dear queen. My lord,
will you vouchsafe me a word?
HELEN
Nay, this shall not hedge us out: we'll hear you
sing, certainly.
PANDARUS
Well, sweet queen. you are pleasant with me. But,
marry, thus, my lord: my dear lord and most esteemed
friend, your brother Troilus,--
HELEN
My Lord Pandarus; honey-sweet lord,--
PANDARUS
Go to, sweet queen, to go:--commends himself most
affectionately to you,--
HELEN
