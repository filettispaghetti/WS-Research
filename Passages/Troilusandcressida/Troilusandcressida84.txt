SCENE II. The same. Before Calchas' tent.

Enter DIOMEDES
DIOMEDES
What, are you up here, ho? speak.
CALCHAS
[Within] Who calls?
DIOMEDES
Calchas, I think. Where's your daughter?
CALCHAS
[Within] She comes to you.
Enter TROILUS and ULYSSES, at a distance; after them, THERSITES

ULYSSES
Stand where the torch may not discover us.
Enter CRESSIDA

TROILUS
Cressid comes forth to him.
DIOMEDES
How now, my charge!
CRESSIDA
Now, my sweet guardian! Hark, a word with you.
Whispers

TROILUS
Yea, so familiar!
ULYSSES
She will sing any man at first sight.
THERSITES
And any man may sing her, if he can take her cliff;
she's noted.
DIOMEDES
Will you remember?
CRESSIDA
Remember! yes.
DIOMEDES
Nay, but do, then;
And let your mind be coupled with your words.
TROILUS
What should she remember?
ULYSSES
List.
CRESSIDA
Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly.
THERSITES
Roguery!
DIOMEDES
Nay, then,--
CRESSIDA
