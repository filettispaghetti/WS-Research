Scene 3

[Enter Pirithous, Hippolyta, Emilia.]


PIRITHOUS
No further.

HIPPOLYTA  Sir, farewell. Repeat my wishes
To our great lord, of whose success I dare not
Make any timorous question; yet I wish him

Store never hurts good governors.

PIRITHOUS  Though I know
His ocean needs not my poor drops, yet they
Must yield their tribute there.--My precious maid,
Those best affections that the heavens infuse
In their best-tempered pieces keep enthroned

The great Bellona I'll solicit; and
Since in our terrene state petitions are not
Without gifts understood, I'll offer to her
What I shall be advised she likes. Our hearts
Are in his army, in his tent.

That have sod their infants in--and after ate them--
The brine they wept at killing 'em. Then if
You stay to see of us such spinsters, we
Should hold you here forever.

PIRITHOUS  Peace be to you
As I pursue this war, which shall be then

Though craving seriousness and skill, passed slightly
