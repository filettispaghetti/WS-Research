The estate of my poor queen. Leave me alone;
For I must think of that which company
Would not be friendly to.
SUFFOLK
I wish your highness
A quiet night; and my good mistress will
Remember in my prayers.
KING HENRY VIII
Charles, good night.
Exit SUFFOLK

Enter DENNY

Well, sir, what follows?
DENNY
Sir, I have brought my lord the archbishop,
As you commanded me.
KING HENRY VIII
Ha! Canterbury?
DENNY
Ay, my good lord.
KING HENRY VIII
'Tis true: where is he, Denny?
DENNY
He attends your highness' pleasure.
Exit DENNY

LOVELL
[Aside] This is about that which the bishop spake:
I am happily come hither.
Re-enter DENNY, with CRANMER

KING HENRY VIII
Avoid the gallery.
LOVELL seems to stay

Ha! I have said. Be gone. What!
Exeunt LOVELL and DENNY

CRANMER
[Aside]
I am fearful: wherefore frowns he thus?
'Tis his aspect of terror. All's not well.
KING HENRY VIII
How now, my lord! you desire to know
Wherefore I sent for you.
CRANMER
[Kneeling] It is my duty
To attend your highness' pleasure.
KING HENRY VIII
