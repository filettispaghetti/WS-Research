The cardinal!
Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CROMWELL

NORFOLK
Observe, observe, he's moody.
CARDINAL WOLSEY
The packet, Cromwell.

CROMWELL
To his own hand, in's bedchamber.
CARDINAL WOLSEY

CROMWELL

Was in his countenance. You he bade
Attend him here this morning.
CARDINAL WOLSEY

To come abroad?
CROMWELL
I think, by this he is.
CARDINAL WOLSEY
Leave me awhile.
Exit CROMWELL

SUFFOLK

a knight's daughter,
