Hautboys. Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, and takes his state

Or gentleman, that is not freely merry,
Is not my friend: this, to confirm my welcome;
And to you all, good health.

SANDS
Your grace is noble:
Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks,
And save me so much talking.
CARDINAL WOLSEY
My Lord Sands,
I am beholding to you: cheer your neighbours.
Ladies, you are not merry: gentlemen,

SANDS

In their fair cheeks, my lord; then we shall have 'em
Talk us to silence.
ANNE
You are a merry gamester,
My Lord Sands.
SANDS
Yes, if I make my play.
Here's to your ladyship: and pledge it, madam,
For 'tis to such a thing,--
ANNE
You cannot show me.
SANDS
I told your grace they would talk anon.

Chamberlain
Look out there, some of ye.
Exit Servant

CARDINAL WOLSEY
What warlike voice,
And to what end is this? Nay, ladies, fear not;
By all the laws of war you're privileged.
