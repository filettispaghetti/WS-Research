woman. Him I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on,
have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
punishment, by thy sweet grace's officer, Anthony
Dull; a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, and
estimation.'
DULL
'Me, an't shall please you; I am Anthony Dull.

[Reads] 'For Jaquenetta,--so is the weaker vessel
called which I apprehended with the aforesaid
swain,--I keep her as a vessel of the law's fury;
and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring
her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted
and heart-burning heat of duty.
DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
BIRON
This is not so well as I looked for, but the best
that ever I heard.
FERDINAND
Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say
you to this?
COSTARD
Sir, I confess the wench.
FERDINAND
Did you hear the proclamation?
COSTARD
I do confess much of the hearing it but little of
the marking of it.
FERDINAND
It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be taken
with a wench.
COSTARD
I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.
FERDINAND
Well, it was proclaimed 'damsel.'
COSTARD
This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.
FERDINAND
It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'
COSTARD
If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.
FERDINAND
This maid will not serve your turn, sir.
COSTARD
This maid will serve my turn, sir.
FERDINAND
Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast
a week with bran and water.
COSTARD
I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.
