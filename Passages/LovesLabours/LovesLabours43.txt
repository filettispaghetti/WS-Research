Like a demigod here sit I in the sky.
And wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'ereye.
More sacks to the mill! O heavens, I have my wish!
Enter DUMAIN, with a paper

Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!
DUMAIN
O most divine Kate!
BIRON
O most profane coxcomb!
DUMAIN
By heaven, the wonder in a mortal eye!
BIRON
By earth, she is not, corporal, there you lie.
DUMAIN
Her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted.
BIRON
An amber-colour'd raven was well noted.
DUMAIN
As upright as the cedar.
BIRON
Stoop, I say;
Her shoulder is with child.
DUMAIN
As fair as day.
BIRON
Ay, as some days; but then no sun must shine.
DUMAIN
O that I had my wish!
LONGAVILLE
And I had mine!
FERDINAND
And I mine too, good Lord!
BIRON
Amen, so I had mine: is not that a good word?
DUMAIN
I would forget her; but a fever she
Reigns in my blood and will remember'd be.
BIRON
A fever in your blood! why, then incision
Would let her out in saucers: sweet misprision!
DUMAIN
Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.
BIRON
Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit.
DUMAIN
[Reads]
On a day--alack the day!--
Love, whose month is ever May,
Spied a blossom passing fair
