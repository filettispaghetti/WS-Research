FERDINAND
I do protest I never heard of it;
And if you prove it, I'll repay it back
Or yield up Aquitaine.
PRINCESS
We arrest your word.
Boyet, you can produce acquittances
For such a sum from special officers
Of Charles his father.
FERDINAND
Satisfy me so.
BOYET
So please your grace, the packet is not come
Where that and other specialties are bound:
To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.
FERDINAND
It shall suffice me: at which interview
All liberal reason I will yield unto.
Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
As honour without breach of honour may
Make tender of to thy true worthiness:
You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;
But here without you shall be so received
As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,
Though so denied fair harbour in my house.
Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:
To-morrow shall we visit you again.
PRINCESS
Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace!
FERDINAND
Thy own wish wish I thee in every place!

BIRON
Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.
ROSALINE
Pray you, do my commendations; I would be glad to see it.
BIRON
I would you heard it groan.
ROSALINE
Is the fool sick?
BIRON
Sick at the heart.
ROSALINE
Alack, let it blood.
BIRON
Would that do it good?
ROSALINE
My physic says 'ay.'
BIRON
