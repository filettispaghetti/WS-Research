Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.
FERDINAND
A letter from the magnificent Armado.
BIRON
How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.
LONGAVILLE
A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!
BIRON
To hear? or forbear laughing?
LONGAVILLE
To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or to
forbear both.
BIRON
Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to
climb in the merriness.
COSTARD
The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.
BIRON
In what manner?
COSTARD
In manner and form following, sir; all those three:
I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with
her upon the form, and taken following her into the
park; which, put together, is in manner and form
following. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is the
manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--
in some form.
BIRON
For the following, sir?
COSTARD
As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend
the right!
FERDINAND
Will you hear this letter with attention?
BIRON
As we would hear an oracle.
COSTARD
Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.
FERDINAND
[Reads] 'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and
sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,
and body's fostering patron.'
COSTARD
Not a word of Costard yet.
FERDINAND
[Reads] 'So it is,'--
COSTARD
It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in
telling true, but so.
