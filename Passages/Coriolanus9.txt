Noble Marcius!
First Senator
[To the Citizens] Hence to your homes; be gone!
MARCIUS
Nay, let them follow:
The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither
To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,
Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.
Citizens steal away. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS

SICINIUS
Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
BRUTUS
He has no equal.
SICINIUS
When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--
BRUTUS
Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
SICINIUS
Nay. but his taunts.
BRUTUS
Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.
SICINIUS
Be-mock the modest moon.
BRUTUS
The present wars devour him: he is grown
Too proud to be so valiant.
SICINIUS
Such a nature,
Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
His insolence can brook to be commanded
Under Cominius.
BRUTUS
Fame, at the which he aims,
In whom already he's well graced, can not
Better be held nor more attain'd than by
A place below the first: for what miscarries
Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure
Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he
Had borne the business!'
SICINIUS
Besides, if things go well,
Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall
Of his demerits rob Cominius.
BRUTUS
Come:
Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.
Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults
