so; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart
as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!
I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.
PRINCE HENRY
Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up
above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good
conscience.
FALSTAFF
Both which I have had: but their date is out, and
therefore I'll hide me.
PRINCE HENRY
Call in the sheriff.
Exeunt all except PRINCE HENRY and PETO

Enter Sheriff and the Carrier

Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?
Sheriff
First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry
Hath follow'd certain men unto this house.
PRINCE HENRY
What men?
Sheriff
One of them is well known, my gracious lord,
A gross fat man.
Carrier
As fat as butter.
PRINCE HENRY
The man, I do assure you, is not here;
For I myself at this time have employ'd him.
And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee
That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,
Send him to answer thee, or any man,
For any thing he shall be charged withal:
And so let me entreat you leave the house.
Sheriff
I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen
Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.
PRINCE HENRY
It may be so: if he have robb'd these men,
He shall be answerable; and so farewell.
Sheriff
Good night, my noble lord.
PRINCE HENRY
I think it is good morrow, is it not?
Sheriff
Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.
Exeunt Sheriff and Carrier

PRINCE HENRY
