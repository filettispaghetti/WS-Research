Iniunccions: Or as is o° ƒhal bee otherwyƒe appoynted by his highnes.
And thoughe there be none to communicate with the P°ie¥e, yet theƒe
dayes (after the Litany ended) the P°ie¥ ƒhall put vpon him a playn
Albe o° ƒurple±e, with a cope, and ƒay al thinges at the Altar (appoynted
to be ƒayed at the celeb°acyon of the lo°des ƒupper), vntill after the
offerto°y. And then ƒhall adde one o° two of the Collectes afo°ewritten,
as occaƒion ƒhall ƒerue by his diƒcrecion. And then turning him to the
people ƒhall let them depart with the accu¥omed ble±ing. 
And the ƒame o°der ƒhall be vƒed all other dayes whenƒoeuer the people
be cu¥omably a±embled to p°ay in the churche, and none diƒpoƒed to
communicate with the P°ie¥.
Lykewyƒe in Chapelles annexed, and all other places, there ƒhalbe
no celeb°acion of the Lo°des ƒupper, except there be ƒome to communicate
with the P°ie¥. And in ƒuche Chapelles annexed where ye
people hath not bene accu¥omed to pay any holy b°ead, there they
mu¥ either make ƒome charitable p°ouiƒion fo° the bering of the
charges of the Communion, o° elles (fo° receyuying of the ƒame)
reƒo°t to theyr Pariƒh Churche.
Fo° aduoyding of all matters and occaƒyon of dyƒcencyon, it is mete
that the b°eade p°epared fo° the Communion, bee made, th°ough all
thys realme, after one ƒo°t and faƒhion: that is to ƒay, vnleauened, and
rounde, as it was afo°e, but without all maner of p°inte, and
ƒomethyng mo°e larger and thicker than it was, ƒo that it may be
aptly deuided in diuers pieces: and enery one ƒhall be deuided in two
pieces, at the lea¥e, o° mo°e, by the diƒcrecion of the mini¥er, and ƒo
di¥ributed. And menne mu¥e not thynke le±e to be receyued in parte
then in the whole, but in eache of them the whole body of our ƒauiour
Jeƒu Ch°i¥.
And fo°ƒomuche as the Pa¥ours and Curates within thys realme
ƒhal continually fynd at theyr co¥es and charges in theyr cures,
ƒufficient Breade and Wyne fo° the holy Communion (as oft as
they° Pariƒhioners ƒhalbe diƒpoƒed fo° they° ƒpiritual comfo°t to
receyue the ƒame) it is therefo°e o°d°ed, that in recompence of ƒuche
co¥es and charges, the Pariƒhioners of euery Pariƒhe ƒhall offer
euery Sonday, at the tyme of the Offerto°y, the iu¥e valour and
p°ice of the holy lofe (with all ƒuche money, and other thinges as
were wont to be offered with the ƒame) to the vƒe of theyr Pa¥ours
and Curates, and that in ƒuche o°d°e and courƒe, as they were woont
to fynde and pay the ƒayd holy lofe.
Alƒo, that the receiuing of the Sacrament of the ble±ed body and
bloud of Ch°i¥, may be mo¥ agreable to the in¥itucion thereof, and to
the vƒage of the p°imitiue Churche: In all Cathederall and Collegiate

Pariƒhe, to whome by courƒe after the o°dinaunce herein made, it
apperteyneth to offer fo° the charges of the Communion, o° ƒome
other whom they ƒhall p°ouide to offer fo° them, ƒhall receiue the holy
