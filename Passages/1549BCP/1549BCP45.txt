in o°iginal ƒynne, and in the w°athe of God, is
nowe by the lauer of regeneracion in Baptiƒme,
made the childe of God, and heire of euerla¥yng life:
fo° oure Lo°de Jeƒus Ch°i¥e doeth not denye hys grace and
mercie vnto ƒuch infantes, but mo¥ louingly doeth call them
vnto him. As the holy ghoƒpell doeth witne±e to our coumfo°te
on this wyƒe.
T a certaine time thei b°ought child°en vnto
Ch°i¥ that he ƒhould touch them, and his
diƒciples rebuked thoƒe that b°ought them.
But when Jeƒus ƒawe it, he was diƒpleaƒed,
and ƒayed vnto them: Suffre lytle chyld°en
to come vnto me, and fo°bidde them not, fo° to ƒuche belongeth
the kingdome of God. Verely I ƒaye vnto you,
whoƒoeuer doeth not receyue the kingdom of God as a lytle
chylde, he ƒhall not enter therm. And when he had taken
them vp in his armes, he put his handes vpon them, and
bli±ed them.

After the ghoƒpell is read: the mini¥er ƒhall make this
exho°tacion vpon the woo°des of the ghoƒpell.
Rendes ye heare in this ghoƒpell the woo°des of our
Saueoure Ch°i¥, that he commaunded the child°en
to be b°ought vnto him, how he blamed thoƒe that would haue
kept them from hym, howe he exho°ted all men to folowe
their innocencie: Ye perceiue how by his outward ge¥ure
and dede he declared his good wyll towarde them, fo° he
emb°aced them in his armes, he layed his handes vpon them, 
P°iuate Baptiƒme
and ble±ed them. Doubt you not therfo°e, but earne¥ly
beleue, that he hath lykewyƒe fauourably receyued this
p°eƒente infante, that he hath emb°aced him with the armes
of his mercy, that he hath geuen vnto him the ble±ing of
eternal lyfe, and made him partaker of his euerla¥ing
kingdom. Wherfo°e we beyng thus perƒuaded of the good
will of oure heauenly father, declared by his ƒonne Jeƒus
Ch°i¥ towardes this infante: Let vs faythfully and
deuoutly geue thankes vnto him, and ƒaye the p°ayer whiche
the Lo°de himƒelfe taught; and in declaracion of our fayth,
let vs alƒo recyte the articles conteined in our Crede.
Here the mini¥er with the God/athers and Godmothers
ƒhall ƒaye.
O Ur father whiche arte in heauen, halowed be thy
name, &c.
Then ƒhall they ƒaye the Crede, and then the p°ie¥e ƒhall
demaund the name of the childe, whiche beyng by the
Godfathers & Godmothers p°onounced, the mini¥er ƒhall
ƒaye.
N. Doe¥ thou fo°ƒake the deuill and all his wo°kes?
