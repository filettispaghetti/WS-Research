O Lorde, with whome dooe lyue the ƒpirites of them
that be dead: and in whome the ƒoules of them that bee
elected, after they be deliuered from the burden of the fleƒhe,
be in ioy and felicitie: Graunte vnto vs thy ƒeruaunte, that
the ƒinnes whiche he committed in this wo°ld be not imputed
vnto him, but that he, eƒcaping the gates of hell and paynes
of eternall derkene±e: may euer dwel in the region of
highte, with Ab°aham, Iƒaac, and Jacob, in the place where
is no wepyng, ƒo°owe, no° heauine±e: and when that d°edeful
day of the generall reƒurreccion ƒhall come, make him to
ryƒe alƒo with the iu¥ and righteous, and receiue this bodie
agayn to glo°y, then made pure and inco°ruptible, ƒet him on
the right hand of thy ƒonne Jeƒus Chri¥, emong thy holy
and elect, that then he may heare with them theƒe mo¥ ƒwete
and coumfo°table wo°des: Come to me ye ble±ed of my
father, po±e±e the kingdome whiche hath bene p°epared fo°
you from the beginning of the wo°lde: Graunte thys we
beƒeche thee, o mercifull father: through Jeƒus Chri¥e our
mediatour and redemer. Amen.

as the hart deƒireth the water-b°ookes, ƒo longeth
y ƒoule afterthee, o God.
My ƒoule is athir¥ fo° god, yea, euen fo° the liuing god :
when ƒhal I come to appeare befo°e the p°eƒence of god?
My teares haue beene my meate day and nighte, whyle
they dayly ƒay vnto me, Where is now thy god?
Nowe when I thinke thereupon, I pow°e out my hart by
my ƒelfe : fo° I went with the multitude, and b°ought them
furth vnto the houƒe of god, in the voyce of p°aiƒe and
thankeƒgeuing, emong ƒuche as kepe holy day.
Why art thou ƒo full of heauines, (O my ƒoule) : and why
art thou ƒo vnquiete within me?
Put thy tru¥ in god, fo° I wil yet geue him thankes, fo° the
helpe of his countenaunce.
My God, my ƒoule is vexed within me : therefo°e will I remember
thee concerning the land of Jo°dane, and the litle
hill of Hermonim.
One deepe calleth another, beecauƒe of the noyƒe of thy
water pypes, all thy waues & ¥o°mes are gone ouer me.
The lo°de hath graunted his louing kyndene±e on the daye
tyme, and in the nighte ƒeaƒon dyd I ƒyng of hym, and made
my p°ayer vnto the god of my lyfe.
