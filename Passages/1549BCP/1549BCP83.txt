Therfo°e b°ethren, take we hede by time, while the day of
ƒaluacion la¥eth, fo° the night cometh when none can wo°ke:
but let vs while we haue the light, beleue in the light, &
walke as the child°en of the light, that we be not ca¥ into the

true hert) we returne vnto him: fo° though our ƒinnes be red
as ƒcarlet, they ƒhalbe as white as ƒnowe, & though they be
lyke purple, yet ƒhall they be as whyte as woolle. Turne
you cleane (ƒayth ye lo°d) from all your wickednes, and
your ƒynne ƒhall not be your de¥ruccion Ca¥ away from
you all your vngodlines that ye haue doen, make you new
