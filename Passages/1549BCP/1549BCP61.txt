And entre not into iudgemente with thy ƒeruaunt : fo° in thy
ƒight ƒhal no man liuing be iu¥ified.
Fo° the enemie bath perƒecuted my ƒoule : he hath ƒmitten
my life downe to the grounde : he hath laied me in the
darkene±e, as the men that haue bene long dead.
Therefo°e is my ƒpirite vexed within me : and my harte
