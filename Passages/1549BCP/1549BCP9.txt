Luc. i
And hath lyfted vp an home of ƒaluacyon to
vs : in the houƒe of his ƒeruaunt Dauid.
As he ƒpake by the mouth of his holy P°ophetes :
which hath bene ƒyns the wo°ld began.
That we ƒhoulde be ƒaued from our enemies : and
from the handes of all that hate vs.
To perfourme the mercy p°omiƒed to our fathers :
and to remember his holy couenaunt.
To perfourme the othe whiche he ƒware to our father
Abraham : that he would geue vs.
That we being deliuered out of the handes of our
enemies might ƒerue him without feare,
In holyne±e and ryghteouƒnes befo°e him all the
dayes of our lyfe. 
Matins.
And thou childe, ƒhalte bee called the p°ophete of the
highe¥: fo° thou ƒhalte goe hefo°e the face of the Lo°d, to
p°epare his wayes.
 To geue knowledge of ƒaluacion vnto his people : fo° the
remi±ion of their ƒinnes.
 Through the tender mercie of our god : whereby the
daye ƒp°yng from an hygh hath viƒited vs;
 To geue lighte to them that ƒitte in darkenes, and in the
ƒhadowe of death : and to guide our fete into the way of
peace.
 Glory be to the father, &c.
 As it was in the beginnyng, &c.
Then ƒhalbe ƒaid dailye th°ough the yere the p°aiers folowing,
aƒwell at euenƒong as at Matins, all deuoutely kneelyng.
 Lo°de haue mercie vpon vs. Ch°i¥e haue mercie vpon vs.
Lo°de, haue mercie vpon vs.
Then the mini¥er ƒhal ƒay the Crede and the Lo°des p°aier in
engliƒhe, with a loude voice, &c.
Anƒwere.
 But deliuer vs from eiuill. Amen.
P°ie¥.
 O Lorde, ƒhewe thy mercie vpon vs.
Anƒwere.
 And graunt vs thy ƒaluacion.
P°ie¥e.
 O Lo°de ƒaue the kyng.
Anƒwere.
 And mercifully heare vs when we cal vpon thee.
P°ie¥e.
 Indue thy mini¥ers with righteouƒnes.
Anƒwere.
 And make thy choƒen people ioyfull.
P°ie¥e.
