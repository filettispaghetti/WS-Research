God: Neyther doeth co°rupcion enherite vnco°rupcion. Behold,
I ƒhewe you a mi¥ery. We ƒhall not all ƒlepe: but we
ƒhal al be chaunged, and that in a momente, in the twynkeling
of an iye by the la¥ trumpe. Fo° the trumpe ƒhall blowe,
and the dead ƒhall ryƒe inco°ruptible, and we ƒhall be
chaunged. Fo° this co°ruptible mu¥ put on inco°rupcion:
and this mo°tall mu¥ put on immo°talitie. When this co°-

Lo°de, haue mercie vpon vs.
Our father whiche art in heauen, &c.
And leade vs not into temptacion.

But deliuer vs from euil. Amen.

Entre not (o lo°de) into iudgement with thy ƒeruaunt.

O lo°de, graciouƒly heare my p°ayer.

And let my crye come vnto thee.
