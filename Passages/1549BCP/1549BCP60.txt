ƒcripture dooeth ƒaye, as touchyng the duetye of houƒebandes
towarde their wiues, and wiues towarde they° houƒebandes.
Saincte Paule (in his epi¥le to the Epheƒians the fyfth
chapter) doeth geue this commaundement to al maried
men.
Ye houƒebandes loue your wiues, euen as Ch°i¥ loued the
churche, and hathe geuen hymƒelfe fo° it, to ƒanctifie it,
purgeyng it in the fountayne of water, th°oughe the wo°d,
that he might make it vnto himƒelf, a glo°ious congregacion,
not hauing ƒpot o° w°incle, o° any ƒuch thing but that it
ƒhould be holy & blameles. So men are bounde to loue their
owne wiues as their owne bodies: he that loueth his owne
wife, loueth himƒelf. Fo° neuer did any man hate his owne
fleƒh, but nouriƒheth and cheriƒheth it, euen as the lo°de doeth
the congregacion, fo° wee are memb°es of his bodie, of his
fleƒhe, and of his bones. Fo° this cauƒe ƒhal a man leaue
father and mother, and ƒhalbe ioyned vnto his wife, & they

two ƒhalbe one fleƒhe. This mi¥ery is great, but I ƒpeake of
Ch°i¥ and of the congregacion. Neuerthele±e let euery one
of you ƒo loue his owne wife, euen as himƒelfe.
Likewiƒe the ƒame Saint Paule (w°iting to the Colo±ians)
ƒpeaketh thus to al menne that be maried: Ye men, loue
your wiues and be not bitter vnto them.
Coloß. iii.
Heare alƒo what ƒaint Peter thapo¥le of Ch°i¥, (which was
himƒelfe a maried man,) ƒayeth vnto al menne that are
maried Ye huƒbandes, dwel with your wiues acco°ding to
knowledge: Geuyng hono° vnto the wife, as vnto the weaker
ve±el, and as hey°es together of the grace of lyfe, ƒo that
your p°ayers be not hind°ed.
1 Pet. iii.
Hitherto ye haue heard the duetie of the huƒbande
towarde the wife.
Nowe lykewiƒe, ye wiues, heare and lerne your
duetie toward your huƒbandes, euen as it is
playnely ƒet furth in holy ƒcripture.
Saint Paul (in the fo°enamed epi¥le to the Epheƒians)
teacheth you thus: Ye weomen ƒubmit yourƒelues vnto
your own huƒbandes as vnto the lo°d: fo° the huƒband is the
wiues head, euen as Ch°i¥ is the head of the church: And he
alƒo is the ƒauiour of the whole bodye. Therefo°e as the
Churche, o° congregacyon, is ƒubiecte vnto Ch°i¥e: So
lykewiƒe let the wiues alƒo be in ƒubieccyon vnto they° owne
huƒbandes in all thynges. And agayn he ƒayeth: Let the
wife reuerence her huƒbande. And (in his epi¥le to the
Colo±ians) Saincte Paule geueth you this ƒho°t le±on. Ye
wiues, ƒubmit yourƒelues vnto your owne huƒbandes, as it
is conueniente in the Lo°de.
