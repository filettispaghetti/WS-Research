Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.
CALIBAN
[Aside] These be fine things, an if they be
not sprites.
That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor.
I will kneel to him.
STEPHANO
How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?
swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I
escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors
heaved o'erboard, by this bottle; which I made of
the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was
cast ashore.
CALIBAN
I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject;
for the liquor is not earthly.
STEPHANO
Here; swear then how thou escapedst.
TRINCULO
Swum ashore. man, like a duck: I can swim like a
duck, I'll be sworn.
STEPHANO
Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a
duck, thou art made like a goose.
TRINCULO
O Stephano. hast any more of this?
STEPHANO
The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by the
sea-side where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!
how does thine ague?
CALIBAN
Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?
STEPHANO
Out o' the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i'
the moon when time was.
CALIBAN
I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:
My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.
STEPHANO
Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnish
it anon with new contents swear.
TRINCULO
By this good light, this is a very shallow monster!
I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The man i'
the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well
drawn, monster, in good sooth!
CALIBAN
I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;
And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.
TRINCULO
