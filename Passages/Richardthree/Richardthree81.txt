DUCHESS OF YORK
Then patiently hear my impatience.
KING RICHARD III
Madam, I have a touch of your condition,
Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.
DUCHESS OF YORK
O, let me speak!
KING RICHARD III
Do then: but I'll not hear.
DUCHESS OF YORK
I will be mild and gentle in my speech.
KING RICHARD III
And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.
DUCHESS OF YORK
Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.
KING RICHARD III
And came I not at last to comfort you?
DUCHESS OF YORK
No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,
Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.
A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,
Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,
Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,
treacherous,
More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:
What comfortable hour canst thou name,
That ever graced me in thy company?
KING RICHARD III
Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd
your grace
To breakfast once forth of my company.
If I be so disgracious in your sight,
Let me march on, and not offend your grace.
Strike the drum.
DUCHESS OF YORK
I prithee, hear me speak.
KING RICHARD III
You speak too bitterly.
DUCHESS OF YORK
Hear me a word;
For I shall never speak to thee again.
KING RICHARD III
So.
DUCHESS OF YORK
Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
