None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing;
Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.
KING RICHARD III
Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
Why dost thou run so many mile about,
When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?

When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
STANLEY

Please it your majesty to give me leave,
I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace
Where and what time your majesty shall please.
KING RICHARD III
Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:
