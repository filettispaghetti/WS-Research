LADY ANNE
God give your graces both
A happy and a joyful time of day!
QUEEN ELIZABETH
As much to you, good sister! Whither away?
LADY ANNE
No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,
Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
To gratulate the gentle princes there.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.
Enter BRAKENBURY

And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
How doth the prince, and my young son of York?
BRAKENBURY
Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
I may not suffer you to visit them;
The king hath straitly charged the contrary.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
The king! why, who's that?
BRAKENBURY
I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?
I am their mother; who should keep me from them?
DUCHESS OF YORK
I am their fathers mother; I will see them.
LADY ANNE
Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:
Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame
And take thy office from thee, on my peril.
BRAKENBURY
No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:
I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.
Exit

Enter LORD STANLEY

LORD STANLEY
Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,
And I'll salute your grace of York as mother,
And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.
To LADY ANNE

Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,
There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.
QUEEN ELIZABETH
