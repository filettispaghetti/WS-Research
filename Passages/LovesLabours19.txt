To let you enter his unpeopled house.
Here comes Navarre.
Enter FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, DUMAIN, BIRON, and Attendants

FERDINAND
Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.
PRINCESS
'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I have
not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be
yours; and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.
FERDINAND
You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.
PRINCESS
I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.
FERDINAND
Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.
PRINCESS
Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.
FERDINAND
Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.
PRINCESS
Why, will shall break it; will and nothing else.
FERDINAND
Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.
PRINCESS
Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,
Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.
I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:
Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,
And sin to break it.
But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:
To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,
And suddenly resolve me in my suit.
FERDINAND
Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.
PRINCESS
You will the sooner, that I were away;
For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.
BIRON
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
ROSALINE
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
BIRON
I know you did.
ROSALINE
How needless was it then to ask the question!
BIRON
You must not be so quick.
ROSALINE
