thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain
to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for
my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set
me to 't. But they say the duke will be here
to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:
if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been
at home, he had lived.
Exit ISABELLA

DUKE VINCENTIO
Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your
reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.
LUCIO
Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:
he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.
LUCIO
Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee
I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.
DUKE VINCENTIO
You have told me too many of him already, sir, if
they be true; if not true, none were enough.
LUCIO
I was once before him for getting a wench with child.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Did you such a thing?
LUCIO
Yes, marry, did I	but I was fain to forswear it;
they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.
LUCIO
By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:
if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of
it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. A room in ANGELO's house.

Enter ANGELO and ESCALUS
ESCALUS
Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.
ANGELO
In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be
not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and
redeliver our authorities there
ESCALUS
I guess not.
