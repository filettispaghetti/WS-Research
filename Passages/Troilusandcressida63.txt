TROILUS
Trouble him not;
To bed, to bed: sleep kill those pretty eyes,
And give as soft attachment to thy senses
As infants' empty of all thought!
CRESSIDA
Good morrow, then.
TROILUS
I prithee now, to bed.
CRESSIDA
Are you a-weary of me?
TROILUS
O Cressida! but that the busy day,
Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,
And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,
I would not from thee.
CRESSIDA
Night hath been too brief.
TROILUS
Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays
As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love
With wings more momentary-swift than thought.
You will catch cold, and curse me.
CRESSIDA
Prithee, tarry:
You men will never tarry.
O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,
And then you would have tarried. Hark!
there's one up.
PANDARUS
[Within] What, 's all the doors open here?
TROILUS
It is your uncle.
CRESSIDA
A pestilence on him! now will he be mocking:
I shall have such a life!
Enter PANDARUS

PANDARUS
How now, how now! how go maidenheads? Here, you
maid! where's my cousin Cressid?
CRESSIDA
Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle!
You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.
PANDARUS
To do what? to do what? let her say
what: what have I brought you to do?
CRESSIDA
Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,
Nor suffer others.
