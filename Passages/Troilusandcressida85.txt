I'll tell you what,--
DIOMEDES
Foh, foh! come, tell a pin: you are forsworn.
CRESSIDA
In faith, I cannot: what would you have me do?
THERSITES
A juggling trick,--to be secretly open.
DIOMEDES
What did you swear you would bestow on me?
CRESSIDA
I prithee, do not hold me to mine oath;
Bid me do any thing but that, sweet Greek.
DIOMEDES
Good night.
TROILUS
Hold, patience!
ULYSSES
How now, Trojan!
CRESSIDA
Diomed,--
DIOMEDES
No, no, good night: I'll be your fool no more.
TROILUS
Thy better must.
CRESSIDA
Hark, one word in your ear.
TROILUS
O plague and madness!
ULYSSES
You are moved, prince; let us depart, I pray you,
Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself
To wrathful terms: this place is dangerous;
The time right deadly; I beseech you, go.
TROILUS
Behold, I pray you!
ULYSSES
Nay, good my lord, go off:
You flow to great distraction; come, my lord.
TROILUS
I pray thee, stay.
ULYSSES
You have not patience; come.
TROILUS
I pray you, stay; by hell and all hell's torments
I will not speak a word!
DIOMEDES
And so, good night.
CRESSIDA
Nay, but you part in anger.
TROILUS
