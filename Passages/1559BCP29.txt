daie# of their life. And we most humbly beseech thee of thy
goodnesse, O Lord, to comfort & succour all them which in
thi# transitory life be in trouble, sorrow, neede, sicknesse, or
any other aduersitie: grant thi#, O Father, for Jesu# Christ#
sake our onely Mediatour and Aduocate. Amen.
¶ Then all follow this exhortation, at certaine times when the Curate all
ſee the people negligent to come to the holy Communion.
E be come together at thi# time, dearely beloued
brethren to feede at the Lord# Supper, vnto the
which in God# behalfe I bid you all that be heere
present, & beseech you for the Lord Jesu# Christ#
sake, that ye will not refuse to come thereto, being so louingly
called, and bidden of God himselfe. Yee know how greuou#
and vnkinde a thing it i#, when a man hath prepared a rich
feast: decked hi# table with all kinde of prouisyon, so that there
lacketh nothing but the guest# to sit down, and yet they which
be called (without any cause) most vnthankfully refuse to come.
Which of you in such a case would not be moued? Who would
not think a great iniurie and wrong done vnto him? Wherefore
moste derely beloued in Christ take yee good heed, lest yee,
wythdrawyng your selue# from thi# holy Supper, and prouoke
God# indignation against you, it i# an easie matter for a man
to say, I will not communicate, because I am otherwise letted
with worldly busynesse, but such excuse# be not so easily accepted
and allowed before God. If any man say, I am a greuou#
sinner, and therefore am afraid to come: wherefore then doe ye
not repent and amend: When God calleth you, bee you not
ashamed to say you wil not come? When you should returne to
God, will you excuse your selue# and say that you be not
ready? consider ernestly with your selue# how little such fained
excuse# shall auaile before God. They that refused the feast in
the Gospel, because they had bought a Farme, or would try
their yoke# of Oxen, or because they were married, were not
so excused, but counted vnworthy of the heuenly feast. I for my
part am here present and according to mine office, I bid you in 
the name of God, I call you in Christ# behalfe, I exhort you,
a# you loue your owne saluation, that ye will bee partaker# of
thi# holy Communion. And a# the Son of God, did vouchsafe
to yeeld vp hi# soule by death vpon the Crosse for your health:
Euen so it i# your dutie to receiue the Communion together in
the remembraunce of hi# death a# he himselfe commanded.
Now, if you wyll in no wise thu# doe, consider with your
selue#, how great iniury you doe vnto God, and howe sore
punishment hangeth ouer your head# for the same. And wherea#
you offend God so sore in refusing thi# holy banket, I
admonish, exhort, and beseech you, that vnto thi# vnkindnesse
yee will not adde any more. Which thing yee shall doe if yee
stand by a# gazer# and looker# of them that do communicate,
and be no partaker# of the same your selue#. For what thing
can thi# be accounted else, then a further contempt and
