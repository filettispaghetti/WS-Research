Varro's Servant	'Twas due on forfeiture, my lord, six weeks And past.
Isidore's Servant	Your steward puts me off, my lord;
And I am sent expressly to your lordship.
TIMON
Give me breath.
I do beseech you, good my lords, keep on;
I'll wait upon you instantly.
Exeunt ALCIBIADES and Lords

To FLAVIUS

Come hither: pray you,
How goes the world, that I am thus encounter'd
With clamourous demands of date-broke bonds,
And the detention of long-since-due debts,
Against my honour?
FLAVIUS
Please you, gentlemen,
The time is unagreeable to this business:
Your importunacy cease till after dinner,
That I may make his lordship understand
Wherefore you are not paid.
TIMON
Do so, my friends. See them well entertain'd.
Exit

FLAVIUS
Pray, draw near.
Exit

Enter APEMANTUS and Fool

CAPHIS
Stay, stay, here comes the fool with Apemantus:
let's ha' some sport with 'em.
Varro's Servant	Hang him, he'll abuse us.
Isidore's Servant	A plague upon him, dog!
Varro's Servant	How dost, fool?
APEMANTUS
Dost dialogue with thy shadow?
Varro's Servant	I speak not to thee.
APEMANTUS
No,'tis to thyself.
To the Fool

Come away.
Isidore's Servant	There's the fool hangs on your back already.
APEMANTUS
No, thou stand'st single, thou'rt not on him yet.
CAPHIS
