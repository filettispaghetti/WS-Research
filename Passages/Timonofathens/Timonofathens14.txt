My heart is ever at your service, my lord.
TIMON
You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a
dinner of friends.
ALCIBIADES
So the were bleeding-new, my lord, there's no meat
like 'em: I could wish my best friend at such a feast.
APEMANTUS
Would all those fatterers were thine enemies then,
that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em!
First Lord
Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you
would once use our hearts, whereby we might express
some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves
for ever perfect.
TIMON
O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods
themselves have provided that I shall have much help
from you: how had you been my friends else? why
have you that charitable title from thousands, did
not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told
more of you to myself than you can with modesty
speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm
you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any
friends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they
were the most needless creatures living, should we
ne'er have use for 'em, and would most resemble
sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their
sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished
myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We
are born to do benefits: and what better or
properer can we can our own than the riches of our
friends? O, what a precious comfort 'tis, to have
so many, like brothers, commanding one another's
fortunes! O joy, e'en made away ere 't can be born!
Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to
forget their faults, I drink to you.
APEMANTUS
Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon.
Second Lord
Joy had the like conception in our eyes
And at that instant like a babe sprung up.
APEMANTUS
Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.
Third Lord
I promise you, my lord, you moved me much.
APEMANTUS
Much!
Tucket, within
