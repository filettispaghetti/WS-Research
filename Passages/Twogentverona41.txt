SPEED
Thou liest; I can.
LAUNCE
I will try thee. Tell me this: who begot thee?
SPEED
Marry, the son of my grandfather.
LAUNCE
O illiterate loiterer! it was the son of thy
grandmother: this proves that thou canst not read.
SPEED
Come, fool, come; try me in thy paper.
LAUNCE
There; and St. Nicholas be thy speed!
SPEED
[Reads] 'Imprimis: She can milk.'
LAUNCE
Ay, that she can.
SPEED
'Item: She brews good ale.'
LAUNCE
And thereof comes the proverb: 'Blessing of your
heart, you brew good ale.'
SPEED
'Item: She can sew.'
LAUNCE
That's as much as to say, Can she so?
SPEED
'Item: She can knit.'
LAUNCE
What need a man care for a stock with a wench, when
she can knit him a stock?
SPEED
'Item: She can wash and scour.'
LAUNCE
A special virtue: for then she need not be washed
and scoured.
SPEED
'Item: She can spin.'
LAUNCE
Then may I set the world on wheels, when she can
spin for her living.
SPEED
'Item: She hath many nameless virtues.'
LAUNCE
That's as much as to say, bastard virtues; that,
indeed, know not their fathers and therefore have no names.
SPEED
'Here follow her vices.'
LAUNCE
Close at the heels of her virtues.
