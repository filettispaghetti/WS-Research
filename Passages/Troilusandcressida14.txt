honesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, to
defend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at a
thousand watches.
PANDARUS
Say one of your watches.
CRESSIDA
Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the
chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would
not have hit, I can watch you for telling how I took
the blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it's
past watching.
PANDARUS
You are such another!
Enter Troilus's Boy

Boy
Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.
PANDARUS
Where?
Boy
At your own house; there he unarms him.
PANDARUS
Good boy, tell him I come.
Exit boy

I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.
CRESSIDA
Adieu, uncle.
PANDARUS
I'll be with you, niece, by and by.
CRESSIDA
To bring, uncle?
PANDARUS
Ay, a token from Troilus.
CRESSIDA
By the same token, you are a bawd.
Exit PANDARUS

Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,
He offers in another's enterprise;
But more in Troilus thousand fold I see
Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be;
Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:
Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.
That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:
Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:
That she was never yet that ever knew
Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.
Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech:
