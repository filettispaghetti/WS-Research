Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
Your crown content and you must be contented
To go along with us; for as we think,
You are the king King Edward hath deposed;
And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
Will apprehend you as his enemy.
KING HENRY VI
But did you never swear, and break an oath?
Second Keeper
No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
KING HENRY VI
Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
Second Keeper
Here in this country, where we now remain.
KING HENRY VI
I was anointed king at nine months old;
My father and my grandfather were kings,
And you were sworn true subjects unto me:
And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?
First Keeper
No;
For we were subjects but while you were king.
KING HENRY VI
Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?
Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!
Look, as I blow this feather from my face,
And as the air blows it to me again,
Obeying with my wind when I do blow,
And yielding to another when it blows,
Commanded always by the greater gust;
Such is the lightness of you common men.
But do not break your oaths; for of that sin
My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.
Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;
And be you kings, command, and I'll obey.
First Keeper
We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.
KING HENRY VI
So would you be again to Henry,
If he were seated as King Edward is.
First Keeper
We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,
To go with us unto the officers.
KING HENRY VI
In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd:
And what God will, that let your king perform;
And what he will, I humbly yield unto.
Exeunt
