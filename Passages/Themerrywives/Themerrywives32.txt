embattled against me. What say you to't, Sir John?
FALSTAFF
Master Brook, I will first make bold with your
money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a
gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.
FORD
O good sir!
FALSTAFF
I say you shall.
FORD
Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.
FALSTAFF
Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want
none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her

know how I speed.
FORD
I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford,
sir?
FALSTAFF

FALSTAFF
Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will
stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my

Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style;
thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and
cuckold. Come to me soon at night.

FORD
What a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is
ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is
improvident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him; the
hour is fixed; the match is made. Would any man
