words. What doth he think of us?
MISTRESS PAGE
Nay, I know not: it makes me almost ready to

They retire

Enter FORD with PISTOL, and PAGE with NYM

FORD
Well, I hope it be not so.
PISTOL

PISTOL
He wooes both high and low, both rich and poor,
Both young and old, one with another, Ford;
He loves the gallimaufry: Ford, perpend.
FORD
Love my wife!
PISTOL
With liver burning hot. Prevent, or go thou,
Like Sir Actaeon he, with Ringwood at thy heels:
