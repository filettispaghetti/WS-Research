SHALLOW
I have lived fourscore years and upward; I never
heard a man of his place, gravity and learning, so
wide of his own respect.
SIR HUGH EVANS
What is he?
PAGE
I think you know him; Master Doctor Caius, the
renowned French physician.
SIR HUGH EVANS
Got's will, and his passion of my heart! I had as
lief you would tell me of a mess of porridge.
PAGE
Why?
SIR HUGH EVANS
He has no more knowledge in Hibocrates and Galen,
--and he is a knave besides; a cowardly knave as you
would desires to be acquainted withal.
PAGE
I warrant you, he's the man should fight with him.
SHALLOW
[Aside] O sweet Anne Page!
SHALLOW
It appears so by his weapons. Keep them asunder:
here comes Doctor Caius.
Enter Host, DOCTOR CAIUS, and RUGBY

PAGE
Nay, good master parson, keep in your weapon.
SHALLOW
So do you, good master doctor.
Host
Disarm them, and let them question: let them keep
their limbs whole and hack our English.
DOCTOR CAIUS
I pray you, let-a me speak a word with your ear.
Vherefore vill you not meet-a me?
SIR HUGH EVANS
[Aside to DOCTOR CAIUS] Pray you, use your patience:
in good time.
DOCTOR CAIUS
By gar, you are de coward, de Jack dog, John ape.
SIR HUGH EVANS
[Aside to DOCTOR CAIUS] Pray you let us not be
laughing-stocks to other men's humours; I desire you
in friendship, and I will one way or other make you amends.
Aloud

I will knog your urinals about your knave's cockscomb
