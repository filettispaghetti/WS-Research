Now these mockers he paynteth with specyal colors wher by thei may be known. Thei shal bring in saith he / pernicyos and dānable sectes / or as Paul saith / thei shal speake lies in hypocrisy vnder the color and pretense of holynes. Forbidding to mary & to absteyne from the meates which god hath created to be receyued of the faithful with thankes geuyng / And thei shal denie

the lord (saith he) which hath bought or re∣demed them / and the way of the truth shal thei slander and reuyle / as certen blasphem¦ers do now a dayes speake blasphemosly of paul / because he doth manifestly confute mans satisfaccyons / rightwisnes / and re∣dempcyō by workes. And therfor / saythe he for couetosnes sake thei shal make marchā¦dise of now thorow fables and false doc∣tryne inuēted of their own braynes / and he compareth thē to Sodom and Gomor and he sayth that thei haue eyes ful of adulte∣ry. But their doctryne peter calleth disceit¦ful fables and he sayth that their sut∣telty must be disclosed by the lantern of the prophetycal scripture. And we haue the word of prophecy / saith he / wher unto ye do well to harken as vnto a candel geuyng lyght in the dark nyght tyl the daye lyght appeare and the mornyng sterre ryse in your hartes / for as moch as ye know that no prophetycal scripture belongeth to mās interpretacyō nor it was neuer thrust vn∣to

us by mās wil / But the holy men of god were inspyred of the holy gost / and moued to speake it.

This is a sure and a substancyal testi∣mony to cōfute all maner of doctrines and tradicyons besyde the scripture / yea and to refuse all maner of doctors and writars which speake any thing of their own bray¦ne without scripture to confirme it. For. s. Peter putteth a speciall difference betwene prophecy or prophetical scripture / and an Interpretacyon which is inuented of mās own brayne and tradicyons which are ma¦de and enioyned at mans cōmandmēt / and he calleth all maner of doctrines which be not conteined in the scripture of the holy goost / capcyos & disceyghtful fables / and he ascribeth an high auctoryte vnto the old prophecy and prophetical scripture. For whan he had alledged for his doctryne the diuinite of christ which he had sene and the voyce of the father which he had hard / and agayn the witnes of Moyses and Elyas 〈2+ pages missing〉

te in wickednes / and thei shal subuert & be¦witch their hearers that thei shal haue gret delight in the deuels cauillacyons and blas¦phemis. Such fals & lying prophetes doth paul set forthe in such lyuely colors as thei ought be paynted with / and maketh a com¦paryson betwene a faythful preacher of the gospel and a false hipocryte and dissem¦bler. And he describeth both by these tokēs.

The tokens of a good and faithful bisshop be these.
j. The husband of one wife.
ij. Sobre.
iij. Discrete.
iiij. Lowely and meke.
v. A keper of hospitalyte.
vj. Apt to teach.

•j. No yong scolar / butt holding the mi¦stery of the fayth wyth a pure conscyence.
False hypocrytes and dissemblers be these.

iij. Geuyn to all pleasures and ryot.
iiij. Proud and vayn glorros.
v. Vnmercyful and cruel.

Now there is no man so blynd or of •o lytle witt which can not discern and know false seducers from true preachers by these tokens / but yet because there be many hi∣pocrytes which pretend to be as holy and de¦uowt as angels thorow their fylthy wyue∣les life / and abstynence from meates / and difference of garmentes / he reproueth this doctrine of theirs by name: saing that thei shal forsake the fayth and the vertu and pyth of holynes. that is to say / the rigtuos∣nes of faith / & that thei shal teach lyes & the deuyls doctrine thorow hypocrisy / na∣mely this / that mariage is vnlauful and forbidden vnto certen persons. Item thei shal put difference betwene meates & gar¦mentes / that one kynd is more holy than a nother. &c. And thei shal affirme that the∣se doctrynes do conteyne in them saluacy∣on / the pyth of holynes / and the perfeccyon of a christen man. And he sayth that these do turn & stopp their eares from the truth and from the holy scripture / turning them

vnto vayne fables / that thei shal not abyde holsom doctrine nor the swete word of our lord Iesus christ that thorow fayth is pro¦fytable vnto true holines / but thei shal pro¦cure them selues a multitude of masters / which shal preache vnto them after their own appetites / & that thei shal dote abowt vayn questyons and contencyons of wor∣des because the truth is takē from them & thei shal byleue surely euen luker to be ho∣lynes because thei be infect and poysoned in their hartes and myndes / and thei shal haue but lytle delight or pleasure in the do∣ctryne of fayth but put their confidence in opynions & articles inuēted of their own braynes and of other men / and those shal thei highly esteme euen for heauenly wis∣dom and true holynes. For thus doth paul him self affirme vnto the thessalonyans / that god shal send them a strong & mygh∣ty blyndnes that thei shal byleue lyes and that all which byleue not the truth and the holsom word of our lord Iesus christ / shal

be damned. he saith also that thei shal ha∣ue delyght and pleasure in vnrigtuosnes that is to say thei shal think them selues saued by those things which haue no ver∣tu of saluaciō in them / namely by the wor¦kes of their own handes which are not con¦fyrmed by the word of god but only by fal∣se and lying myracles. Such do not harkē vnto the angels singyng glory be vnto god aboue / and peace delyght & ioy vnto men in the erth &c. For thei can not delight them selues vpon this infant / because he is sym∣ple myserable / abiect / and disfigured with the crosse of affliccion / for thei think luker to be holynes / thei seke ryches and hygh em¦pyres or kyngdoms / thei geue no eare vnto god speaking from heauen. This is my dearly beloued sonne in whom I delight / but thei delight in other things than in him / in whom god wold us to delight and reioyse. And ther for paul biddeth us to∣shunne them / saing / that thei ought not to he herd / and that no man ought to dispute

or reason with them / but that we ought to fle from them as from an infectuos can¦ker / and to stop our eares at theyr bablyng & capcyos disceyght ful wordes and folissh and wicked questyons / & he wil not suffre us to moue one hear brede out of the scriptu¦re to cople or reason with thē / but to resist and withstand them with the holy scriptu¦re / for he saith. But thow stand fast in tho¦se things which thou hast lerned & in tho∣se things which are cōmitted vnto the / re∣membrīg of whom thou hast lerned them and that euersyns thou wart a child / thou hast known the holy scriptures which be able to make the perfyghtly lerned / thorow faith / vnto the saluacyō which is in christ Iesus / for as moch as all scripture inspi∣red by god / is profitable to teach / and to re∣proue. &c. And paul reasoneth thus. A biss∣hop ought to resist his aduersarys with that lernīg wherby he maye be enstruct in the doctryne of faith / eschew the doctrines of the deuel / and saue both himself and his
Page  [unnumbered]
hearers. But the holy scripture is such ler∣ning / wher for he ought to resist by the ho∣ly scripture. which reasō he proueth by the propertys of a good and faithful preacher. For the property sayth he of a true teacher is eyther.

To teach / to improue false doctryne to amend and edyfye / or to instruct in rightwisnes.

For / as he sayth / a bisshop must be apt to teach and to reproue the aduersarys of the faith / and he must be such one as must be myghtie and also able to conuynce them that be aduersaris to the truth / & further more such as erre thorow ignorance or in∣firmytie / thei must reforme them in to the ryght way / fynally it is necessary for chil∣dern to be norisshed with mylke and gentle instruccyons. Now if the holy scriptures be sufficyent to teach & instruct perfyght¦ly / thā it must nedes folow that all thīgs necessary vnto saluacyon may be taught owt of them. And agayne if thei be suffici¦ent to cōuynce them which resist the truth
