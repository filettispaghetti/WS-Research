To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.
GREY
God keep the prince from all the pack of you!
A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!
VAUGHAN
You live that shall cry woe for this after.
RATCLIFF
Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.
RIVERS
O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
Within the guilty closure of thy walls
Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,
We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.
GREY
Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.
RIVERS
Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,
Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God
To hear her prayers for them, as now for us
And for my sister and her princely sons,
Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.
RATCLIFF
Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.
RIVERS
Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all embrace:
And take our leave, until we meet in heaven.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. The Tower of London.

Enter BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, the BISHOP OF ELY, RATCLIFF, LOVEL, with others, and take their seats at a table
HASTINGS
My lords, at once: the cause why we are met
Is, to determine of the coronation.
In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?
BUCKINGHAM
Are all things fitting for that royal time?
DERBY
It is, and wants but nomination.
BISHOP OF ELY
To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.
BUCKINGHAM
Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?
Who is most inward with the royal duke?
BISHOP OF ELY
