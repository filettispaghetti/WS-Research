for that. If you would conjure in her, you must
make a circle; if conjure up love in her in his true
likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you
blame her then, being a maid yet rosed over with the
virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the
appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing
self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid
to consign to.
KING HENRY V
Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.
BURGUNDY
They are then excused, my lord, when they see not
what they do.
KING HENRY V
Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.
BURGUNDY
I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will
teach her to know my meaning: for maids, well
summered and warm kept, are like flies at
Bartholomew-tide, blind, though they have their
eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
before would not abide looking on.

and so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the
latter end and she must be blind too.
BURGUNDY

my wish shall show me the way to my will.
FRENCH KING
We have consented to all terms of reason.
KING HENRY V
Is't so, my lords of England?
WESTMORELAND
The king hath granted every article:
