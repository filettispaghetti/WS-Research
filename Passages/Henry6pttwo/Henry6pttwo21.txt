An't like your lordly lord-protectorship.
GLOUCESTER
Why, Suffolk, England knows thine insolence.
QUEEN MARGARET
And thy ambition, Gloucester.
KING HENRY VI
I prithee, peace, good queen,
And whet not on these furious peers;
For blessed are the peacemakers on earth.
CARDINAL
Let me be blessed for the peace I make,
Against this proud protector, with my sword!
GLOUCESTER
[Aside to CARDINAL] Faith, holy uncle, would
'twere come to that!
CARDINAL
[Aside to GLOUCESTER] Marry, when thou darest.
GLOUCESTER
[Aside to CARDINAL] Make up no factious
numbers for the matter;
In thine own person answer thy abuse.
CARDINAL
[Aside to GLOUCESTER] Ay, where thou darest
not peep: an if thou darest,
This evening, on the east side of the grove.
KING HENRY VI
How now, my lords!
CARDINAL
Believe me, cousin Gloucester,
Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly,
We had had more sport.
Aside to GLOUCESTER

Come with thy two-hand sword.
GLOUCESTER
True, uncle.
CARDINAL
[Aside to GLOUCESTER] Are ye advised? the
east side of the grove?
GLOUCESTER
[Aside to CARDINAL] Cardinal, I am with you.
KING HENRY VI
Why, how now, uncle Gloucester!
GLOUCESTER
Talking of hawking; nothing else, my lord.
Aside to CARDINAL

Now, by God's mother, priest, I'll shave your crown for this,
Or all my fence shall fail.
CARDINAL
