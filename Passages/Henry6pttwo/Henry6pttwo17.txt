For single combat in convenient place,
For he hath witness of his servant's malice:
This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey's doom.
SOMERSET
I humbly thank your royal majesty.
HORNER
And I accept the combat willingly.
PETER
Alas, my lord, I cannot fight; for God's sake, pity

GLOUCESTER

KING HENRY VI
Away with them to prison; and the day of combat
shall be the last of the next month. Come,
Somerset, we'll see thee sent away.
Flourish. Exeunt

Enter MARGARET JOURDAIN, HUME, SOUTHWELL, and BOLINGBROKE
HUME

HUME

BOLINGBROKE

Exit HUME

read you; and let us to our work.
Enter the DUCHESS aloft, HUME following

DUCHESS
Well said, my masters; and welcome all. To this
gear the sooner the better.
BOLINGBROKE
Patience, good lady; wizards know their times:
Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,
