TO THE RIGHT
HONORABLE, HENRY
Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton,
and Baron of Titchfield.


The love I dedicate to your Lordship is without end; whereof this
pamphlet without beginning is but a superfluous moiety. The warrant
I have of your honorable disposition, not the worth of my untutored
lines, makes it assured of acceptance. What I have done is
yours; what I have to do is yours; being part in all I have, devoted
yours. Were my worth greater, my duty would show greater; meantime,
as it is, it is bound to your Lordship, to whom I wish long life
still lengthened with all happiness.

Your Lordship's in all duty,
William Shakespeare

pleasant humor they all posted to Rome, and intending by their secret
and sudden arrival to make trial of that which every one had
before avouched, only Collatinus finds his wife, though it were late
in the night, spinning amongst her maids; the other ladies were all
found dancing and reveling or in several disports; whereupon the
noblemen yielded Collatinus the victory and his wife the fame. At
that time Sextus Tarquinius, being inflamed with Lucrece' beauty,
yet smothering his passions for the present, departed with the rest
back to the camp; from whence he shortly after privily withdrew
himself and was, according to his estate, royally entertained and
lodged by Lucrece at Collatium. The same night he treacherously
