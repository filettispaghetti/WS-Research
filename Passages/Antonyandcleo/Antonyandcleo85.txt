Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us
Ourselves to end ourselves.
Enter MARDIAN

O! thy vile lady!
She has robb'd me of my sword.
MARDIAN
No, Antony;
My mistress loved thee, and her fortunes mingled
With thine entirely.
MARK ANTONY
Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!
She hath betray'd me and shall die the death.
MARDIAN
Death of one person can be paid but once,
And that she has discharged: what thou wouldst do
Is done unto thy hand: the last she spake
Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
The name of Antony; it was divided
Between her heart and lips: she render'd life,
Thy name so buried in her.
MARK ANTONY
Dead, then?
MARDIAN
Dead.
MARK ANTONY
Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
And we must sleep.
To MARDIAN

That thou depart'st hence safe,
Does pay thy labour richly; go.
Exit MARDIAN

Off, pluck off:
The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep
The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!
Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,
Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.
No more a soldier: bruised pieces, go;
You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.
Exit EROS

I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
All length is torture: since the torch is out,
Lie down, and stray no farther: now all labour
Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
Itself with strength: seal then, and all is done.
