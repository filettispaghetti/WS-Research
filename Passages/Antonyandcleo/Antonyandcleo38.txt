MENAS
[Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have
made this treaty.--You and I have known, sir.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
At sea, I think.
MENAS
We have, sir.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
You have done well by water.
MENAS
And you by land.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
I will praise any man that will praise me; though it
cannot be denied what I have done by land.
MENAS
Nor what I have done by water.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Yes, something you can deny for your own
safety: you have been a great thief by sea.
MENAS
And you by land.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
There I deny my land service. But give me your
hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they
might take two thieves kissing.
MENAS
All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
MENAS
No slander; they steal hearts.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
We came hither to fight with you.
MENAS
For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.
Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.
MENAS
You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony
here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Caesar's sister is called Octavia.
MENAS
True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
MENAS
Pray ye, sir?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
