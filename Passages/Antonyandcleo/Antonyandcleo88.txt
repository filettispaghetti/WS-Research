And time is at his period.
All
Alas, and woe!
MARK ANTONY
Let him that loves me strike me dead.
First Guard
Not I.
Second Guard
Nor I.
Third Guard
Nor any one.
Exeunt Guard

DERCETAS
Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.
This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,
Shall enter me with him.
Enter DIOMEDES

DIOMEDES
Where's Antony?
DERCETAS
There, Diomed there.
DIOMEDES
Lives he?
Wilt thou not answer, man?
Exit DERCETAS

MARK ANTONY
Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give me
Sufficing strokes for death.
DIOMEDES
Most absolute lord,
My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.
MARK ANTONY
When did she send thee?
DIOMEDES
Now, my lord.
MARK ANTONY
Where is she?
DIOMEDES
Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear
Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw--
Which never shall be found--you did suspect
She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage
Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead;
But, fearing since how it might work, hath sent
Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,
I dread, too late.
MARK ANTONY
