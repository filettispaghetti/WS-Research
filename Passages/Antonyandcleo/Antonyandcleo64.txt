Caesar, I go.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,
And what thou think'st his very action speaks
In every power that moves.
THYREUS
Caesar, I shall.
Exeunt

SCENE XIII. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

Enter CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS
CLEOPATRA
What shall we do, Enobarbus?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Think, and die.
CLEOPATRA
Is Antony or we in fault for this?
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Antony only, that would make his will
Lord of his reason. What though you fled
From that great face of war, whose several ranges
Frighted each other? why should he follow?
The itch of his affection should not then
Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,
When half to half the world opposed, he being
The meered question: 'twas a shame no less
Than was his loss, to course your flying flags,
And leave his navy gazing.
CLEOPATRA
Prithee, peace.
Enter MARK ANTONY with EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador

MARK ANTONY
Is that his answer?
EUPHRONIUS
Ay, my lord.
MARK ANTONY
The queen shall then have courtesy, so she
Will yield us up.
EUPHRONIUS
He says so.
MARK ANTONY
Let her know't.
To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,
And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
With principalities.
CLEOPATRA
That head, my lord?
MARK ANTONY
