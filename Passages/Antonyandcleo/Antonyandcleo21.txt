Not if the small come first.
LEPIDUS
Your speech is passion:
But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes
The noble Antony.
Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
And yonder, Caesar.
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA

MARK ANTONY
If we compose well here, to Parthia:
Hark, Ventidius.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
I do not know,
Mecaenas; ask Agrippa.
LEPIDUS
Noble friends,
That which combined us was most great, and let not
A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
May it be gently heard: when we debate
Our trivial difference loud, we do commit
Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,
The rather, for I earnestly beseech,
Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
Nor curstness grow to the matter.
MARK ANTONY
'Tis spoken well.
Were we before our armies, and to fight.
I should do thus.
Flourish

OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Welcome to Rome.
MARK ANTONY
Thank you.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Sit.
MARK ANTONY
Sit, sir.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Nay, then.
MARK ANTONY
I learn, you take things ill which are not so,
Or being, concern you not.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
I must be laugh'd at,
If, or for nothing or a little, I
Should say myself offended, and with you
