This wine for Lepidus!
LEPIDUS
What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
MARK ANTONY
It is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as broad
as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,
and moves with its own organs: it lives by that
which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of
it, it transmigrates.
LEPIDUS
What colour is it of?
MARK ANTONY
Of it own colour too.
LEPIDUS
'Tis a strange serpent.
MARK ANTONY
'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Will this description satisfy him?
MARK ANTONY
With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a
very epicure.
POMPEY
[Aside to MENAS] Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of
that? away!
Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?
MENAS
[Aside to POMPEY] If for the sake of merit thou
wilt hear me,
Rise from thy stool.
POMPEY
[Aside to MENAS] I think thou'rt mad.
The matter?
Rises, and walks aside

MENAS
I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
POMPEY
Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?
Be jolly, lords.
MARK ANTONY
These quick-sands, Lepidus,
Keep off them, for you sink.
MENAS
Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
POMPEY
What say'st thou?
MENAS
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
POMPEY
