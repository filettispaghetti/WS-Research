First Attendant
The man from Sicyon,--is there such an one?
Second Attendant
He stays upon your will.
MARK ANTONY
Let him appear.
These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,
Or lose myself in dotage.
Enter another Messenger

What are you?
Second Messenger
Fulvia thy wife is dead.
MARK ANTONY
Where died she?
Second Messenger

Importeth thee to know, this bears.
Gives a letter

MARK ANTONY
Forbear me.
Exit Second Messenger

There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:
What our contempt doth often hurl from us,
We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
By revolution lowering, does become
The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;
The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.
I must from this enchanting queen break off:
Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!
Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

if they suffer our departure, death's the word.
MARK ANTONY
I must be gone.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were
pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between
them and a great cause, they should be esteemed
