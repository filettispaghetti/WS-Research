Second Soldier
'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved,
Now leaves him.
First Soldier
Walk; let's see if other watchmen
Do hear what we do?
They advance to another post

Second Soldier
How now, masters!
All
[Speaking together] How now!
How now! do you hear this?
First Soldier
Ay; is't not strange?
Third Soldier
Do you hear, masters? do you hear?
First Soldier
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
Let's see how it will give off.
All
Content. 'Tis strange.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. The same. A room in the palace.

Enter MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and others attending
MARK ANTONY
Eros! mine armour, Eros!
CLEOPATRA
Sleep a little.
MARK ANTONY
No, my chuck. Eros, come; mine armour, Eros!
Enter EROS with armour

Come good fellow, put mine iron on:
If fortune be not ours to-day, it is
Because we brave her: come.
CLEOPATRA
Nay, I'll help too.
What's this for?
MARK ANTONY
Ah, let be, let be! thou art
The armourer of my heart: false, false; this, this.
CLEOPATRA
Sooth, la, I'll help: thus it must be.
MARK ANTONY
Well, well;
We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?
Go put on thy defences.
