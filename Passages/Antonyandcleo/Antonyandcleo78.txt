DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
I am alone the villain of the earth,
And feel I am so most. O Antony,
Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
My better service, when my turpitude
Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart:
If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.
I fight against thee! No: I will go seek
Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
My latter part of life.
Exit

SCENE VII. Field of battle between the camps.

Alarum. Drums and trumpets. Enter AGRIPPA and others
AGRIPPA
Retire, we have engaged ourselves too far:
Caesar himself has work, and our oppression
Exceeds what we expected.
Exeunt

Alarums. Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS wounded

SCARUS
O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed!
Had we done so at first, we had droven them home
With clouts about their heads.
MARK ANTONY
Thou bleed'st apace.
SCARUS
I had a wound here that was like a T,
But now 'tis made an H.
MARK ANTONY
They do retire.
SCARUS
We'll beat 'em into bench-holes: I have yet
Room for six scotches more.
Enter EROS

EROS
They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
For a fair victory.
SCARUS
Let us score their backs,
And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind:
'Tis sport to maul a runner.
MARK ANTONY
I will reward thee
