Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope
Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!
Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. Another room.

Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a Soothsayer
CHARMIAN
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas,
almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer
that you praised so to the queen? O, that I knew
this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns
with garlands!
ALEXAS
Soothsayer!
Soothsayer
Your will?
CHARMIAN
Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
Soothsayer
In nature's infinite book of secrecy
A little I can read.
ALEXAS
Show him your hand.
Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
Cleopatra's health to drink.
CHARMIAN
Good sir, give me good fortune.
Soothsayer
I make not, but foresee.
CHARMIAN
Pray, then, foresee me one.
Soothsayer
You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
CHARMIAN
He means in flesh.
IRAS
No, you shall paint when you are old.
CHARMIAN
Wrinkles forbid!
ALEXAS
Vex not his prescience; be attentive.
CHARMIAN
Hush!
Soothsayer
You shall be more beloving than beloved.
CHARMIAN
