A' bears the third part of the world, man; see'st
not?
MENAS
The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,
That it might go on wheels!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Drink thou; increase the reels.
MENAS
Come.
POMPEY
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.
MARK ANTONY
It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?
Here is to Caesar!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
I could well forbear't.
It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,
And it grows fouler.
MARK ANTONY
Be a child o' the time.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Possess it, I'll make answer:
But I had rather fast from all four days
Than drink so much in one.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Ha, my brave emperor!
To MARK ANTONY

Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,
And celebrate our drink?
POMPEY
Let's ha't, good soldier.
MARK ANTONY
Come, let's all take hands,
Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense
In soft and delicate Lethe.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
All take hands.
Make battery to our ears with the loud music:
The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing;
The holding every man shall bear as loud
As his strong sides can volley.
Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand

THE SONG.
Come, thou monarch of the vine,
Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!
In thy fats our cares be drown'd,
With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:
Cup us, till the world go round,
