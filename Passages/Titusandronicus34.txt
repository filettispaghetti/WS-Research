And send it to the king: he for the same
Will send thee hither both thy sons alive;
And that shall be the ransom for their fault.
TITUS ANDRONICUS
O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!
Did ever raven sing so like a lark,
That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?
With all my heart, I'll send the emperor My hand:
Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?
LUCIUS
Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,
That hath thrown down so many enemies,
Shall not be sent: my hand will serve the turn:
My youth can better spare my blood than you;
And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.
MARCUS ANDRONICUS
Which of your hands hath not defended Rome,
And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe,
Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?
O, none of both but are of high desert:
My hand hath been but idle; let it serve
To ransom my two nephews from their death;
Then have I kept it to a worthy end.
AARON
Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
For fear they die before their pardon come.
MARCUS ANDRONICUS
My hand shall go.
LUCIUS
By heaven, it shall not go!
TITUS ANDRONICUS
Sirs, strive no more: such wither'd herbs as these
Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.
LUCIUS
Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,
Let me redeem my brothers both from death.
MARCUS ANDRONICUS
And, for our father's sake and mother's care,
Now let me show a brother's love to thee.
TITUS ANDRONICUS
Agree between you; I will spare my hand.
LUCIUS
Then I'll go fetch an axe.
MARCUS ANDRONICUS
But I will use the axe.
Exeunt LUCIUS and MARCUS

TITUS ANDRONICUS
Come hither, Aaron; I'll deceive them both:
Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.
