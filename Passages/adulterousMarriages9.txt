Is Chrystes lawe therfore to be accused, as cōpellyng murther to be done, seyng it calleth it adultery to marry her yt is put away wtout the cryme of fornication? In this matier (if we cōsidre & marke what we say) many more weightie thin∣ges may be spoken than you haue sayd. For you, whyles that you wyll not haue it adultery to put a∣way their adulterous wyues & to marry other, haue found out this

yt yf we call these adulteries, yt mē shal be cōpelled to kyll their adul¦terouse wifes, by whose lyfe they be stopped to marie other, and to amplifie thys matier, you sayde, this semeth not to me, moste louīg father, to be a godly sense, wher gentilnes & pitie is excluded. Thā yf any man not willyng to beleue it adulterie, whē a woman forsa∣ken of her husbād wtout the crime of fornicatiō▪ is maried of an other man, dothe inuent thys agaynste you yt by that reason men are in∣duced to cōmitt murders, & by all trayns & sclanders they cāe to lye in wayte for ye husbandes of these womē which being forsakē wtout cryme of fornicatiō they haue ma∣ried, or els by some true crymes to accuse thē and kyll thē, that when they are dead they may be true ma¦riages,

For it is a great dele more lyght & tolerable, yt the husbādes shuld kil their adulterouse wifes, than that adulterours shuld kyll their wyfes former husbandes. Dothe it please you, that for thys moste vayn enuie, we shulde for∣sake ye defence of the lordes minde and sentence, or els that we shuld moreouer accuse it, saiyng, adul∣terie ought not to bee punished & reuenged, although a womā for∣saken wtout the cause of fornica∣tion be ioyned to another mā, leste

I knowe thys pleaseth not you, yt for thys moste vayn en∣uie Christes lawe, beynge founde true and holsome, shuld be called hard & vnmercifull. Euen so after this sorte, you ought not to be of thys minde, to denie it to be adul∣terie, when the secōd wyfe is ma∣ried, ye first adulterouse wyfe beīg alyue, because ye husband by that means may be cōpelled to kyl the adulterous wife, whiles yt he desi∣rethe yt it may be lawfull for hym to marie an other wife, she beynge slayn, yf it be not lawfull to do it, she beyng aliue. For what & yf the sclanderers & enemies of Christes fayth shuld also speake this, that

men were compelled to kyll their wiues, by wicked mischiefe & craf∣tie traines whiche they coulde not beare, beynge paynfull and gre∣uouse to dwell wt all, or els being sycke with a cōtinual disease, and not able to lye with them, or els being poore, or els for loue of som fairer wiues: because it is not lau∣full besyde the cause of fornicatiō to forsake & put away these wiues which they wyll not beare, and ma¦rye other, lest that they beyng boū∣den in a perpetuall adulterye, can neyther bee baptized, nor by pe∣naunce healed. Shal we therfore saye, leste these myscheuous mur∣ders be doon, that they commytt no adulteryes, that put away ther wiues besyde the cause of fornica∣tion, and be maried to other?

But nowe for as moche as you*

thinke it is no adulterie, yf a man put away his wyfe for fornicatiō, and marie an other, doo you not thīke we ought to beware, leste mē by this opinion shuld learn to cō∣pell their wyues to cōmit adulte∣ry, which wyfes for other innume∣rable causes they can not beare, that whē the bond of matrimonie is (as you suppose) by their fornica¦tion dissolued, it may be lawfull for the men to marie other: & for yt they cōpelled their wiues to cōmit adulterie, eyther to be washed by baptism or healed by penaūce, for bothe grace & medicine shal be de∣nied to thē, so longe as they shall lyue in adulterie wt their second wifes, hauing put away their for∣mer wyfes besyde ye cause of forni¦cation? Excepte perchaunce, some man say, yt no man can cause hys
Page  [unnumbered]
wife to cōmytt adultery, yf she be chaste: and yet ye lord saithe, euery man yt putteth away hys wyfe be∣side ye cause of fornicatiō, maketh her to commit adulterye, therfore truely, because when she lyued chaste wt her husbande▪ yet being put away, she is cōpelled in yt she lyuethe not continently to be cou∣pled wt an other man, her former husband beyng alyue, & yt is to cō¦mitt adulterie. And yf she doo not thus, yet he, for as moche as per∣teynethe to hym, caused her to doo it, & god will impute that sinne to him, althoughe she remain chaste. But who knowethe not, howe few there be, yt lyue so chastely wt their husbādes, yt although they be put from thē, yet doo not seke for other husbādes. For wtout cōparison ye number of women is greater, that
Page  [unnumbered]
where as they lyue chastely wyth their husbādes, yet yf they be put from their husbādes, doo not dif∣fer to be maried againe. Therfore whē men shall beleue god, saiyng: Euery mā that putteth away hys wyfe besyde the cause of fornica∣tion, causeth her to cōmyt adulte∣ry: if they beleue also you, saiyng: yf the woman cōmyt fornication, her husband may lawfully marie an other wyfe: whosoeuer for any other kynde of grefes wold lacke hys wyfe wt whom he is ioyned, firste he causeth her to cōmit adul¦terie, by puttinge her away, wtout cause of fornicatiō, that he myght than marye an other, when she by marienge is an adultresse, & so he beyng deliuered eyther by bap∣tisme or by penaunce frō the first synne wherby he caused her to cō∣mitte

adultery, myght seeme to haue & inioye wtout any adulte∣rie of hys parte, the second wyfe, which he maried after the adulte∣rie of ye first, the bond of matrimo∣nye by yt meanes beinge as it wer dissolued. Which thing yf any mā shal attempte or interpryse: bothe he shal cause his wyfe to commyt adulterye, & he shall be an adulte¦roure hym selfe, althoughe he ma¦rie an other after the adulterye of hys wyfe, and it shall profite him nothing, that he beleued you, and not rather hym, ye saithe without any exception: euery man that for∣sakethe hys wyfe and mariethe an other, commyttethe adulterye.

All whiche thinges wel conside¦red and intreated,* it folowethe yt they yt heare these thīges diligētly shuld say to vs yt same yt was said

to the lorde, yf thys be ye state of a man wt his wyfe,* it is not expediēt to marie. Tho whom what shulde we answer again, but yt he answe∣red, euery man takethe not thys worde, but they to whō it is giuē? There be Eunuches yt be so borne from their mothers wōbe, & there be Eunuches yt be made so of mē, & there be Eunuches yt gelde them selfes for ye kyngedome of heauē. He yt may take, let him take. Ther∣fore he yt may take, let hym take, whiche all men take not, but they may take, to whom the secrete iust mercy of God geueth ye gyft. But amōg all these that geld thē selfes for the kyngdome of heauen, there be some of bothe kyndes, yt neuer knewe carnal copulatiō, some that haue had experiēce of it, & are tur∣ned frō it refusyng it, other som yt haue proued it, partely lawfully,

partely vnlawfully. Morouer of thē yt haue proued it laufully, som there be yt haue proued onely law∣fully, some bothe vnlawfully and lawfully. For amonge them there be some yt knowe onely their own wyfes, some that know also other women & all kynde of adulterie. But they yt after carnall copula∣tion wt their wyfes, geld them sel∣fes for the kyngdome of heauen, eyther loose their wifes by deathe, or professe to lyue continently wt thē by mutuall consent, or by ne∣cessitie of diuorses, leste by mariēg of other, their wyfes beinge alyue they shuld cōmitt adulterye, doo geld thē selfes for the kyngedome of heauen, not yt they myghte be more clere & purer there, but that they can not otherwise be there, for they yt lyue cōtinently not for this

necessitie, but for desyre of ye grea∣ter good, may be ther, euē keping styll the chastitie of mariage, al∣thoughe in lesse rewardes, yet within the kyngdome of heauen. But they that lyue therfore conti∣nently, because they feare to be ma¦ried to other, their former wyues beinge aliue: ought to take more care for their own saluation, than they tooke that loued continencie for greater reward. For than they shall be there, if they be not adul∣terers. And yf they doo not lyue continently, they shall be adulte∣rours, for during the lifes of their former wiues they shal not ioyne theim selues with other lawfull wyues but with adulterous wo∣men. And yf they shall be absent from the kyngedome of heauen, where shal they be, but wher they shall not be saued▪

These men therfore do I speake vnto,* that what thyng they ought to do, yf thei had their wiues liyng sicke and consuminge in a conti∣nuall diseasse, or els absent in a place where they coulde not come vnto them, or els of some vnlaw∣full stomake refreynynge to kepe carnall cōpany with thē: the same thinge they shulde doo, yf their wyues dyd committe fylthy adul∣terie, and for that cause diuorsyng them selues from their wyues cō∣pany, shuld not seke newe maria∣ges, because they shall not be ma∣riages, but adulteries. For seing ther is lyke forme in this bond of matrimonie betwē ye husbād & the wyfe, like as ye wyfe duryng here husbandes lyfe, shall be called an adultresse if she be wt another mā:
Page  [unnumbered]
euen so the man, during his wifes lyfe, shal be called an adulterer yf he be wt an other adulterouse wo∣mā. For althoughe it be more gre¦uouse sinn, beside ye cause of forni∣catiō, yet euery mā yt putteth away his wife & mariethe an other, com∣mittethe adulterie. Let not ye bur∣dyn of continencye feare them: it shall be a lyghte burden, yf it be Christes, it shalbe christes yf faith be presēt, which obteineth of christ ye cōmaunder, ye performing of the commaundemēt. Let it not moue thē, that their continent lyuynge, semethe to be of necessitie, & not of wyl: for they also that haue chosen continēcy by their wyl, haue made it to be of necessitie, because they can not nowe without damnation go from it, and they that be driuē vnto it by necessitie, make it to be
Page  [unnumbered]
voluntarie, yf they trust, not in thē selfes, but in hym from whō euery good thing commethe. Some doe clyme vp to thys gyfte of conti∣nēcy, for the cause of more glorie, that they might attein some grea∣ter rewarde: other some flye vnto it, for ye care and thoughte of their finall saluation, leste they shulde perishe and be condemned: but let thē bothe remayn, let bothe walke euen to the laste end in that state they haue cōmed vnto, let thē be feruent in studye and desire, let thē be suppliant in prayer, because ye one sorte muste thinke vpon their saluation, & beware they faul not from that their will hathe chosen: and the other sort may not dis∣paire of greater glorye, yf they loue to persyste and continue in ye state that necessitie hathe brought

thē vnto. For it may be possible & come to passe, that by god fearing and exhorting, conuerting and re∣plenishinge, mans affection may he chaūged vnto the better: and yt they shuld vowe to lyue moste cō∣stātely to their liues end, without mariage, without any carnall co∣pulation, and experience of filthy and vnclene pleasure: yt althoughe ye dissolutiō of mariage by death, gyue them occasion to marie other wifes, yet it shulde be shut & boūd by vowe, that was opē and free by lawfulnes▪ and yt it shuld be made perfite by charitie, that was begō by necessitie, to suche truely lyke rewarde shall be gyuen, as to thē, that by mutual consent with their wyfes doo vowe continencye, or els beynge vnmaried, haue chosen continēt life for the greater good.

But yf they liue continently after this sorte, that they be in minde to marye other womē, yf their wyues dye by whose lyfe they be stopped from suche mariages: truely al∣thoughe they departe before oute of ther bodyes, in that kynd of cō∣tinent lyfe, yet it can not be impu∣ted but for chastitie in mariage, for the whiche they doo not yt they wold doo yf it were lawfull. For to lyue continently with thys in∣tent, is lytle to the atteynynge of ye rewarde of continencie whiche is frely chosen, yet it is sufficient to auoyd adulteries.

See that you remembre that I speake these thinges of bothe the kindes of man & womā,* but speci∣ally for mē: which therfore thinke thē selfes to be superiours to wo∣men, lest they shuld vouchesafe to

be like in chastitie, wherin they ought to go before, yt their wyues myght folow thē as their heades. And seinge the lawe forbiddethe adulteries, yf the excuse of carnall infirmitie be admitted vnder pre∣tence of incontinēcie, there shall be an occasion of sinne & destruction giuen to many vnder the name & coloure of fained lawfulnes and impunitie. For women also haue fleshe as men haue, to whom men will not any suche thing shuld be lawfull, as thoughe it wer lawful to them because they be men. But god forbid, that any thyng shulde be due to the honour of mā being the better kynd, that is a deroga∣tion to the chaste honestye of the same, seyng yt iust honor is due to vertue & not to vice. And truely seinge men require so great cha∣stitie
Page  [unnumbered]
of women hauinge fleshe as they haue, yt when they haue been very longe absent frō their wiues yet they wold haue thē passe ouer the heate of their youthe vndefi∣led with any adulterouse compa∣nie of man: and very many moste chaste women, specially in Syria passe ouer their youthe honestely, whose husbandes beinge occupied about ye gaines of merchaundise, leaue their wiues very younge, and scarsely at laste returne again old men to their old wifes: by this facte they proue euidently that it is not vnpossible whiche they al∣ledge for thē selfes that they can not doo. For yf the infirmitie of man can not doo it: moche lesse the weker kind of women can doo it. For which cause when we put thē in feare that thinke the excellencie
Page  [unnumbered]
of man is nothing but a licence to sinne, leste by the means of adul∣terouse maryages they myghte perishe for euer more: we are woont to sette ye cōtinencie of cler∣kes before thē, which often times are taken againste their wils to beare that burden, whiche when they haue taken it, performe it by godes helpe euen to the due end of their lifes. And therfore we say to them, what yf you also be taken by the violence of the people to beare this burden, wolde you not kepe ye office which you haue takē vpon you chastely, beinge sodenly conuerted to purchase strengthe of the Lorde, whyche you neuer thought of before? But, say they, honour dothe comforte thē muche & we answer againe, let feare tem∣per and bridle you the more. For

yf many of gods ministers take sodenly and at vnwares, thys of∣fice that is laid vpō them, hoping that they shall more bryghtly shyne in ye inheritaunce of Christe howe moche more oughte you, beinge ware of adulteries, to lyue continently, fearinge not to shyne lesse in the kyngdome of god, but to burn more in the fyre of hell. These and suche lyke, as we can, we say vnto them, that going frō their wiues by any means, or put∣tynge them away for adultery, will nedes marry other, and when they are forbid, they alledge to vs the infirmitie of their fleshe. But now thys booke also is to be en∣ded, and god is to be prayed, that either he wolde not suffre them to be tempted by the separation of their wiues: or els suffre them so,
