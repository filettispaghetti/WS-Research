had ne'er come here.
Bawd
Fie, fie upon her! she's able to freeze the god
Priapus, and undo a whole generation. We must
either get her ravished, or be rid of her. When she
should do for clients her fitment, and do me the
kindness of our profession, she has me her quirks,
her reasons, her master reasons, her prayers, her
knees; that she would make a puritan of the devil,
if he should cheapen a kiss of her.
BOULT
'Faith, I must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish us
of all our cavaliers, and make our swearers priests.
Pandar
Now, the pox upon her green-sickness for me!
Bawd
'Faith, there's no way to be rid on't but by the
way to the pox. Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.
BOULT
We should have both lord and lown, if the peevish
baggage would but give way to customers.
Enter LYSIMACHUS

LYSIMACHUS
How now! How a dozen of virginities?
Bawd
Now, the gods to-bless your honour!
BOULT
I am glad to see your honour in good health.
LYSIMACHUS
You may so; 'tis the better for you that your
resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
wholesome iniquity have you that a man may deal
withal, and defy the surgeon?
Bawd
We have here one, sir, if she would--but there never
came her like in Mytilene.
LYSIMACHUS
If she'ld do the deed of darkness, thou wouldst say.
Bawd
Your honour knows what 'tis to say well enough.
LYSIMACHUS
Well, call forth, call forth.
BOULT
For flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall
see a rose; and she were a rose indeed, if she had but--
LYSIMACHUS
What, prithee?
BOULT
O, sir, I can be modest.
