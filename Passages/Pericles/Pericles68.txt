If you have told Diana's altar true,
This is your wife.
PERICLES
Reverend appearer, no;
I threw her overboard with these very arms.
CERIMON
Upon this coast, I warrant you.
PERICLES
'Tis most certain.
CERIMON
Look to the lady; O, she's but o'erjoy'd.
Early in blustering morn this lady was
Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,
Found there rich jewels; recover'd her, and placed her
Here in Diana's temple.
PERICLES
May we see them?
CERIMON
Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house,
Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is recovered.
THAISA
O, let me look!
If he be none of mine, my sanctity
Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,
But curb it, spite of seeing. O, my lord,
Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake,
Like him you are: did you not name a tempest,
A birth, and death?
PERICLES
The voice of dead Thaisa!
THAISA
That Thaisa am I, supposed dead
And drown'd.
PERICLES
Immortal Dian!
THAISA
Now I know you better.
When we with tears parted Pentapolis,
The king my father gave you such a ring.
Shows a ring

PERICLES
This, this: no more, you gods! your present kindness
Makes my past miseries sports: you shall do well,
That on the touching of her lips I may
Melt and no more be seen. O, come, be buried
A second time within these arms.
MARINA
My heart
Leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom.
