Good madam, make me blessed in your care
In bringing up my child.
DIONYZA
I have one myself,
Who shall not be more dear to my respect
Than yours, my lord.
PERICLES
Madam, my thanks and prayers.
CLEON
We'll bring your grace e'en to the edge o' the shore,
Then give you up to the mask'd Neptune and
The gentlest winds of heaven.
PERICLES
I will embrace
Your offer. Come, dearest madam. O, no tears,
Lychorida, no tears:
Look to your little mistress, on whose grace
You may depend hereafter. Come, my lord.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. Ephesus. A room in CERIMON's house.

Enter CERIMON and THAISA
CERIMON
Madam, this letter, and some certain jewels,
Lay with you in your coffer: which are now
At your command. Know you the character?
THAISA
It is my lord's.
That I was shipp'd at sea, I well remember,
Even on my eaning time; but whether there
Deliver'd, by the holy gods,
I cannot rightly say. But since King Pericles,
My wedded lord, I ne'er shall see again,
A vestal livery will I take me to,
And never more have joy.
CERIMON
Madam, if this you purpose as ye speak,
Diana's temple is not distant far,
Where you may abide till your date expire.
Moreover, if you please, a niece of mine
Shall there attend you.
THAISA
My recompense is thanks, that's all;
Yet my good will is great, though the gift small.
Exeunt
