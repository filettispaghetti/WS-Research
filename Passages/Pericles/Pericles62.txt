The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?
MARINA
Where I am but a stranger: from the deck
You may discern the place.
PERICLES
Where were you bred?
And how achieved you these endowments, which
You make more rich to owe?
MARINA
If I should tell my history, it would seem
Like lies disdain'd in the reporting.
PERICLES
Prithee, speak:
Falseness cannot come from thee; for thou look'st
Modest as Justice, and thou seem'st a palace
For the crown'd Truth to dwell in: I will
believe thee,
And make my senses credit thy relation
To points that seem impossible; for thou look'st
Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?
Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--
Which was when I perceived thee--that thou camest
From good descending?
MARINA
So indeed I did.
PERICLES
Report thy parentage. I think thou said'st
Thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury,
And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,
If both were open'd.
MARINA
Some such thing
I said, and said no more but what my thoughts
Did warrant me was likely.
PERICLES
Tell thy story;
If thine consider'd prove the thousandth part
Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I
Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look
Like Patience gazing on kings' graves, and smiling
Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?
How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?
Recount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me.
MARINA
My name is Marina.
PERICLES
O, I am mock'd,
And thou by some incensed god sent hither
To make the world to laugh at me.
MARINA
