From stem to stern: the boatswain whistles, and
The master calls, and trebles their confusion.
LEONINE
Come, say your prayers.
MARINA
What mean you?
LEONINE
If you require a little space for prayer,
I grant it: pray; but be not tedious,
For the gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn
To do my work with haste.
MARINA
Why will you kill me?
LEONINE
To satisfy my lady.
MARINA
Why would she have me kill'd?
Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
I never did her hurt in all my life:
I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn
To any living creature: believe me, la,
I never kill'd a mouse, nor hurt a fly:
I trod upon a worm against my will,
But I wept for it. How have I offended,
Wherein my death might yield her any profit,
Or my life imply her any danger?
LEONINE
My commission
Is not to reason of the deed, but do it.
MARINA
You will not do't for all the world, I hope.
You are well favour'd, and your looks foreshow
You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately,
When you caught hurt in parting two that fought:
Good sooth, it show'd well in you: do so now:
Your lady seeks my life; come you between,
And save poor me, the weaker.
LEONINE
I am sworn,
And will dispatch.
He seizes her

First Pirate
Hold, villain!
LEONINE runs away

Second Pirate
A prize! a prize!
