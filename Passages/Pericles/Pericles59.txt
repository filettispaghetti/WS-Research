LYSIMACHUS
You wish me well.
Being on shore, honouring of Neptune's triumphs,
Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us,

You may;
But bootless is your sight: he will not speak To any.
LYSIMACHUS
Yet let me obtain my wish.
HELICANUS
Behold him.

And other chosen attractions, would allure,
And make a battery through his deafen'd parts,
Which now are midway stopp'd:
