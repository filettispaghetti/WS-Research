By your furtherance I am clothed in steel;
And, spite of all the rapture of the sea,
This jewel holds his building on my arm:
Unto thy value I will mount myself
Upon a courser, whose delightful steps
Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread.
Only, my friend, I yet am unprovided
Of a pair of bases.
Second Fisherman
We'll sure provide: thou shalt have my best gown to
make thee a pair; and I'll bring thee to the court myself.
PERICLES
Then honour be but a goal to my will,
This day I'll rise, or else add ill to ill.
Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. A public way or platform leading to the

lists. A pavilion by the side of it for the
reception of King, Princess, Lords, & c.
Enter SIMONIDES, THAISA, Lords, and Attendants

SIMONIDES
Are the knights ready to begin the triumph?
First Lord
They are, my liege;
And stay your coming to present themselves.
SIMONIDES
Return them, we are ready; and our daughter,
In honour of whose birth these triumphs are,
Sits here, like beauty's child, whom nature gat
For men to see, and seeing wonder at.
Exit a Lord

THAISA
It pleaseth you, my royal father, to express
My commendations great, whose merit's less.
SIMONIDES
It's fit it should be so; for princes are
A model which heaven makes like to itself:
As jewels lose their glory if neglected,
So princes their renowns if not respected.
'Tis now your honour, daughter, to explain
The labour of each knight in his device.
THAISA
Which, to preserve mine honour, I'll perform.
Enter a Knight; he passes over, and his Squire presents his shield to the Princess

SIMONIDES
Who is the first that doth prefer himself?
