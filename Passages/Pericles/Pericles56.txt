The nobleman would have dealt with her like a
nobleman, and she sent him away as cold as a
snowball; saying his prayers too.
Bawd
Boult, take her away; use her at thy pleasure:
crack the glass of her virginity, and make the rest malleable.
BOULT
An if she were a thornier piece of ground than she
is, she shall be ploughed.
MARINA
Hark, hark, you gods!
Bawd
She conjures: away with her! Would she had never
come within my doors! Marry, hang you! She's born
to undo us. Will you not go the way of women-kind?
Marry, come up, my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays!
Exit

BOULT
Come, mistress; come your ways with me.
MARINA
Whither wilt thou have me?
BOULT
To take from you the jewel you hold so dear.
MARINA
Prithee, tell me one thing first.
BOULT
Come now, your one thing.
MARINA
What canst thou wish thine enemy to be?
BOULT
Why, I could wish him to be my master, or rather, my mistress.
MARINA
Neither of these are so bad as thou art,
Since they do better thee in their command.
Thou hold'st a place, for which the pained'st fiend
Of hell would not in reputation change:
Thou art the damned doorkeeper to every
Coistrel that comes inquiring for his Tib;
To the choleric fisting of every rogue
Thy ear is liable; thy food is such
As hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.
BOULT
What would you have me do? go to the wars, would
you? where a man may serve seven years for the loss
of a leg, and have not money enough in the end to
buy him a wooden one?
MARINA
Do any thing but this thou doest. Empty
OLD receptacles, or common shores, of filth;
