Second Sailor
Sir, we have a chest beneath the hatches, caulked
and bitumed ready.
PERICLES
I thank thee. Mariner, say what coast is this?
Second Sailor
We are near Tarsus.
PERICLES
Thither, gentle mariner.
Alter thy course for Tyre. When canst thou reach it?
Second Sailor
By break of day, if the wind cease.
PERICLES
O, make for Tarsus!
There will I visit Cleon, for the babe
Cannot hold out to Tyrus: there I'll leave it
At careful nursing. Go thy ways, good mariner:
I'll bring the body presently.
Exeunt

I have been in many; but such a night as this,
Till now, I ne'er endured.

Your master will be dead ere you return;
There's nothing can be minister'd to nature
That can recover him.

Give this to the 'pothecary,
