Psalms 78:38	But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
Psalms 78:39	For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
Psalms 78:40	How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!
Psalms 78:41	Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
Psalms 78:42	They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
Psalms 78:43	How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
Psalms 78:44	And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
Psalms 78:45	He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
Psalms 78:46	He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.
Psalms 78:47	He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.
Psalms 78:48	He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
Psalms 78:49	He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
Psalms 78:50	He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
Psalms 78:51	And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
Psalms 78:52	But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
Psalms 78:53	And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
Psalms 78:54	And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
Psalms 78:55	He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
Psalms 78:56	Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
Psalms 78:57	But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
Psalms 78:58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
Psalms 78:59	When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
Psalms 78:60	So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;
Psalms 78:61	And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.
Psalms 78:62	He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
Psalms 78:63	The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
Psalms 78:64	Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
Psalms 78:65	Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
Psalms 78:66	And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
Psalms 78:67	Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
Psalms 78:68	But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
Psalms 78:69	And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.
Psalms 78:70	He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
Psalms 78:71	From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
Psalms 78:72	So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
Psalms 79:1	O god, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
Psalms 79:2	The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
Psalms 79:3	Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.
Psalms 79:4	We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
Psalms 79:5	How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
Psalms 79:6	Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
Psalms 79:7	For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
Psalms 79:8	O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.
Psalms 79:9	Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.
Psalms 79:10	Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed.
Psalms 79:11	Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;
Psalms 79:12	And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
Psalms 79:13	So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.
Psalms 80:1	Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.
Psalms 80:2	Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us.
