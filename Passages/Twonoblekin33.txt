SECOND COUNTRYMAN  And Sennois and Rycas; and
three better lads ne'er danced under green tree.
And you know what wenches, ha! But will the
dainty domine, the Schoolmaster, keep touch, do
you think? For he does all, you know.

THIRD COUNTRYMAN  He'll eat a hornbook ere he fail.
Go to, the matter's too far driven between him and
the tanner's daughter to let slip now; and she must
see the Duke, and she must dance too.

FOURTH COUNTRYMAN  Shall we be lusty?

SECOND COUNTRYMAN  All the boys in Athens blow wind
i' th' breech on 's. And here I'll be and there I'll be,
for our town, and here again, and there again. Ha,
boys, hey for the weavers!

FIRST COUNTRYMAN  This must be done i' th' woods.

FOURTH COUNTRYMAN  O pardon me.

SECOND COUNTRYMAN  By any means; our thing of learning
says so--where he himself will edify the Duke
most parlously in our behalfs. He's excellent i' th'
woods; bring him to th' plains, his learning makes
no cry.

THIRD COUNTRYMAN  We'll see the sports, then every
man to 's tackle. And, sweet companions, let's rehearse,
by any means, before the ladies see us, and
do sweetly, and God knows what may come on 't.

FOURTH COUNTRYMAN  Content. The sports once ended,
we'll perform. Away, boys, and hold.
[Arcite comes forward.]

ARCITE  By your leaves, honest friends: pray you,
whither go you?

FOURTH COUNTRYMAN  Whither?
Why, what a question's that?

ARCITE  Yes, 'tis a question
To me that know not.

THIRD COUNTRYMAN  To the games, my friend.

SECOND COUNTRYMAN
Where were you bred, you know it not?
