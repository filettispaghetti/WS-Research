1 Corinthians 12:17	If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?
1 Corinthians 12:18	But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.
1 Corinthians 12:19	And if they were all one member, where were the body?
1 Corinthians 12:20	But now are they many members, yet but one body.
1 Corinthians 12:21	And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
1 Corinthians 12:22	Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:
1 Corinthians 12:23	And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.
1 Corinthians 12:24	For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked.
1 Corinthians 12:25	That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.
1 Corinthians 12:26	And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.
1 Corinthians 12:27	Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
1 Corinthians 12:28	And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.
1 Corinthians 12:29	Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?
1 Corinthians 12:30	Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
1 Corinthians 12:31	But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.
1 Corinthians 13:1	Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
1 Corinthians 13:2	And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
1 Corinthians 13:3	And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
1 Corinthians 13:4	Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
1 Corinthians 13:5	Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;
1 Corinthians 13:6	Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
1 Corinthians 13:7	Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
1 Corinthians 13:8	Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.
1 Corinthians 13:9	For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
1 Corinthians 13:10	But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
1 Corinthians 13:11	When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
1 Corinthians 13:12	For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
1 Corinthians 13:13	And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.
1 Corinthians 14:1	Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.
1 Corinthians 14:2	For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.
1 Corinthians 14:3	But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.
1 Corinthians 14:4	He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.
1 Corinthians 14:5	I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.
1 Corinthians 14:6	Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?
1 Corinthians 14:7	And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
1 Corinthians 14:8	For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?
1 Corinthians 14:9	So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.
1 Corinthians 14:10	There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.
1 Corinthians 14:11	Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.
1 Corinthians 14:12	Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.
1 Corinthians 14:13	Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.
1 Corinthians 14:14	For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.
1 Corinthians 14:15	What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
1 Corinthians 14:16	Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?
1 Corinthians 14:17	For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.
1 Corinthians 14:18	I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:
1 Corinthians 14:19	Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.
1 Corinthians 14:20	Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.
1 Corinthians 14:21	In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.
1 Corinthians 14:22	Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.
