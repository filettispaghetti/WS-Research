Luke 23:16	I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
Luke 23:17	(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
Luke 23:18	And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:
Luke 23:19	(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)
Luke 23:20	Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.
Luke 23:21	But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.
Luke 23:22	And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.
Luke 23:23	And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.
Luke 23:24	And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
Luke 23:25	And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.
Luke 23:26	And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.
Luke 23:27	And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.
Luke 23:28	But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.
Luke 23:29	For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.
Luke 23:30	Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
Luke 23:31	For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
Luke 23:32	And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
Luke 23:33	And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
Luke 23:34	Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.
Luke 23:35	And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.
Luke 23:36	And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,
Luke 23:37	And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.
Luke 23:38	And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Luke 23:39	And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.
Luke 23:40	But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
Luke 23:41	And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
Luke 23:42	And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.
Luke 23:43	And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.
Luke 23:44	And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
Luke 23:45	And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
Luke 23:46	And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.
Luke 23:47	Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
Luke 23:48	And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.
Luke 23:49	And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.
Luke 23:50	And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:
Luke 23:51	(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.
Luke 23:52	This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
Luke 23:53	And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.
Luke 23:54	And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
Luke 23:55	And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.
Luke 23:56	And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.
Luke 24:1	Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.
Luke 24:2	And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
Luke 24:3	And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
Luke 24:4	And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:
Luke 24:5	And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
Luke 24:6	He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,
Luke 24:7	Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.
Luke 24:8	And they remembered his words,
Luke 24:9	And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.
