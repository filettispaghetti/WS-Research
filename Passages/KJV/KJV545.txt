Acts 8:11	And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.
Acts 8:12	But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.

Acts 8:14	Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:
Acts 8:15	Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:
Acts 8:16	(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)
Acts 8:17	Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.
Acts 8:18	And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,
Acts 8:19	Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.

Acts 8:21	Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
Acts 8:22	Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.
Acts 8:23	For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.
Acts 8:24	Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.
