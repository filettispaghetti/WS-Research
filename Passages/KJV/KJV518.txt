Luke 20:22	Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?
Luke 20:23	But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?
Luke 20:24	Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's.
Luke 20:25	And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.
Luke 20:26	And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.
Luke 20:27	Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,
Luke 20:28	Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
Luke 20:29	There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.
Luke 20:30	And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.
Luke 20:31	And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.
Luke 20:32	Last of all the woman died also.
Luke 20:33	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.
Luke 20:34	And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:
Luke 20:35	But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:
Luke 20:36	Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.
Luke 20:37	Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
Luke 20:38	For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.
Luke 20:39	Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.
Luke 20:40	And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.
Luke 20:41	And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son?
Luke 20:42	And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
Luke 20:43	Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.
Luke 20:44	David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?
Luke 20:45	Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,
Luke 20:46	Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;
Luke 20:47	Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.
Luke 21:1	And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.
Luke 21:2	And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.
Luke 21:3	And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:
Luke 21:4	For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.
Luke 21:5	And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,
Luke 21:6	As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
Luke 21:7	And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?
Luke 21:8	And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.
Luke 21:9	But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.
Luke 21:10	Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
Luke 21:11	And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.
Luke 21:12	But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.
Luke 21:13	And it shall turn to you for a testimony.
Luke 21:14	Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:
Luke 21:15	For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.
Luke 21:16	And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.
Luke 21:17	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.
Luke 21:18	But there shall not an hair of your head perish.
Luke 21:19	In your patience possess ye your souls.
Luke 21:20	And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.
Luke 21:21	Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.
Luke 21:22	For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
Luke 21:23	But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.
Luke 21:24	And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.
