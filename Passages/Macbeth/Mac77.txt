So great a day as this is cheaply bought.

MALCOLM
Macduff is missing, and your noble son.

ROSS
Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt.
He only lived but till he was a man,
The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed
In the unshrinking station where he fought,
But like a man he died.

SIWARD  Then he is dead?

ROSS
Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow
Must not be measured by his worth, for then
It hath no end.

SIWARD  Had he his hurts before?

ROSS
Ay, on the front.

SIWARD  Why then, God's soldier be he!
Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
I would not wish them to a fairer death;
And so his knell is knolled.

MALCOLM
He's worth more sorrow, and that I'll spend for
him.

SIWARD  He's worth no more.
They say he parted well and paid his score,
And so, God be with him. Here comes newer
comfort.

[Enter Macduff with Macbeth's head.]


MACDUFF
Hail, King! for so thou art. Behold where stands
Th' usurper's cursed head. The time is free.
I see thee compassed with thy kingdom's pearl,
That speak my salutation in their minds,
Whose voices I desire aloud with mine.
Hail, King of Scotland!

ALL  Hail, King of Scotland!	[Flourish.]
