That Christendom gives out.

ROSS  Would I could answer
This comfort with the like. But I have words
That would be howled out in the desert air,
Where hearing should not latch them.

MACDUFF  What concern
they--
The general cause, or is it a fee-grief
Due to some single breast?

ROSS  No mind that's honest
But in it shares some woe, though the main part
Pertains to you alone.

MACDUFF  If it be mine,
Keep it not from me. Quickly let me have it.

ROSS
Let not your ears despise my tongue forever,
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
That ever yet they heard.

MACDUFF  Hum! I guess at it.

ROSS
Your castle is surprised, your wife and babes
Savagely slaughtered. To relate the manner
Were on the quarry of these murdered deer
To add the death of you.

MALCOLM  Merciful heaven!--
What, man, ne'er pull your hat upon your brows.
Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak
Whispers the o'erfraught heart and bids it break.

MACDUFF  My children too?

ROSS
Wife, children, servants, all that could be found.

MACDUFF
And I must be from thence? My wife killed too?

ROSS  I have said.

MALCOLM  Be comforted.
Let's make us med'cines of our great revenge
To cure this deadly grief.
