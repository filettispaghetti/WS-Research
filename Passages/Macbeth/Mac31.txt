Is 't known who did this more than bloody deed?

MACDUFF
Those that Macbeth hath slain.

ROSS  Alas the day,
What good could they pretend?

MACDUFF  They were suborned.
Malcolm and Donalbain, the King's two sons,
Are stol'n away and fled, which puts upon them
Suspicion of the deed.

ROSS  'Gainst nature still!
Thriftless ambition, that will ravin up
Thine own lives' means. Then 'tis most like
The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.

MACDUFF
He is already named and gone to Scone
To be invested.

ROSS  Where is Duncan's body?

MACDUFF  Carried to Colmekill,
The sacred storehouse of his predecessors
And guardian of their bones.

ROSS  Will you to Scone?

MACDUFF
No, cousin, I'll to Fife.

ROSS  Well, I will thither.

MACDUFF
Well, may you see things well done there. Adieu,
Lest our old robes sit easier than our new.

ROSS  Farewell, father.

OLD MAN
God's benison go with you and with those
That would make good of bad and friends of foes.
