Our will became the servant to defect,
Which else should free have wrought.

BANQUO  All's well.
I dreamt last night of the three Weird Sisters.
To you they have showed some truth.

MACBETH  I think not of

To feeling as to sight? Or art thou but
A dagger of the mind, a false creation
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
I see thee yet, in form as palpable
As this which now I draw.	[He draws his dagger.]
Thou marshal'st me the way that I was going,
And such an instrument I was to use.
Mine eyes are made the fools o' th' other senses
Or else worth all the rest. I see thee still,
And, on thy blade and dudgeon, gouts of blood,
