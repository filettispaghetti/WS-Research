
LADY MACBETH  Out, damned spot, out, I say! One. Two.
Why then, 'tis time to do 't. Hell is murky. Fie, my
lord, fie, a soldier and afeard? What need we fear
who knows it, when none can call our power to
account? Yet who would have thought the old man
to have had so much blood in him?

DOCTOR  Do you mark that?

LADY MACBETH  The Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is
she now? What, will these hands ne'er be clean? No
more o' that, my lord, no more o' that. You mar all
with this starting.

DOCTOR  Go to, go to. You have known what you should
not.

GENTLEWOMAN  She has spoke what she should not,
I am sure of that. Heaven knows what she has
known.

LADY MACBETH  Here's the smell of the blood still. All
the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
hand. O, O, O!

DOCTOR  What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely
charged.

GENTLEWOMAN  I would not have such a heart in my
bosom for the dignity of the whole body.

DOCTOR  Well, well, well.

GENTLEWOMAN  Pray God it be, sir.

DOCTOR  This disease is beyond my practice. Yet I have
known those which have walked in their sleep,
who have died holily in their beds.

LADY MACBETH  Wash your hands. Put on your nightgown.
Look not so pale. I tell you yet again, Banquo's
buried; he cannot come out on 's grave.

DOCTOR  Even so?

LADY MACBETH  To bed, to bed. There's knocking at the
gate. Come, come, come, come. Give me your
hand. What's done cannot be undone. To bed, to
bed, to bed.	[Lady Macbeth exits.]
