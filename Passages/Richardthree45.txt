Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.
BUCKINGHAM
You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,
Too ceremonious and traditional
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
You break not sanctuary in seizing him.

And those who have the wit to claim the place:
This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;

You break no privilege nor charter there.
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
But sanctuary children ne'er till now.

For your best health and recreation.
PRINCE EDWARD

Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.
PRINCE EDWARD
Is it upon record, or else reported
Successively from age to age, he built it?
BUCKINGHAM
Upon record, my gracious lord.
PRINCE EDWARD
But say, my lord, it were not register'd,
Methinks the truth should live from age to age,
As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
Even to the general all-ending day.
