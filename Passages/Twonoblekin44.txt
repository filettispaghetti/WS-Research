The moon is down, the crickets chirp, the screech
owl
Calls in the dawn. All offices are done
Save what I fail in. But the point is this--
An end, and that is all.

Scene 3
=======
[Enter Arcite with meat, wine, and files.]


ARCITE
I should be near the place.--Ho! Cousin Palamon!

PALAMON, [within]
Arcite?

ARCITE  The same. I have brought you food and files.
Come forth and fear not; here's no Theseus.

[Enter Palamon.]


PALAMON
Nor none so honest, Arcite.

ARCITE  That's no matter.
We'll argue that hereafter. Come, take courage;
You shall not die thus beastly. Here, sir, drink--
I know you are faint--then I'll talk further with you.

PALAMON
Arcite, thou mightst now poison me.

ARCITE  I might;
But I must fear you first. Sit down and, good now,
No more of these vain parleys. Let us not,
Having our ancient reputation with us,
Make talk for fools and cowards. To your health.
[He drinks.]

PALAMON  Do!

ARCITE
Pray sit down, then, and let me entreat you,
By all the honesty and honor in you,
No mention of this woman; 'twill disturb us.
We shall have time enough.
