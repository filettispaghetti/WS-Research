JULIA
Not so; but it hath been the longest night
That e'er I watch'd and the most heaviest.
Exeunt

I am thus early come to know what service
It is your pleasure to command me in.
SILVIA
O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman--
Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not--
Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish'd:
