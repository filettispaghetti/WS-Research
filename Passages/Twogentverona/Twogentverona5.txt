If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.
PROTEUS
Nay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you.
SPEED
Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for
carrying your letter.
PROTEUS
You mistake; I mean the pound,--a pinfold.
SPEED
From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,
'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to
your lover.
PROTEUS
But what said she?
SPEED
[First nodding] Ay.
PROTEUS
Nod--Ay--why, that's noddy.
SPEED
You mistook, sir; I say, she did nod: and you ask
me if she did nod; and I say, 'Ay.'
PROTEUS
And that set together is noddy.
SPEED
Now you have taken the pains to set it together,
take it for your pains.
PROTEUS
No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.
SPEED
Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
PROTEUS
Why sir, how do you bear with me?
SPEED
Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing
but the word 'noddy' for my pains.
PROTEUS
Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
SPEED
And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
PROTEUS
Come come, open the matter in brief: what said she?
SPEED
Open your purse, that the money and the matter may
be both at once delivered.
PROTEUS
Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?
SPEED
Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.
PROTEUS
Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?
