But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?
SPEED
She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?
VALENTINE
Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.
SPEED
Why, sir, I know her not.
VALENTINE
Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet
knowest her not?
SPEED
Is she not hard-favoured, sir?
VALENTINE
Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.
SPEED
Sir, I know that well enough.
VALENTINE
What dost thou know?
SPEED
That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.
VALENTINE
I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.
SPEED
That's because the one is painted and the other out
of all count.
VALENTINE
How painted? and how out of count?
SPEED
Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no
man counts of her beauty.
VALENTINE
How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.
SPEED
You never saw her since she was deformed.
VALENTINE
How long hath she been deformed?
SPEED
Ever since you loved her.
VALENTINE
I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still I
see her beautiful.
SPEED
If you love her, you cannot see her.
VALENTINE
Why?
SPEED
Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes;
or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going
ungartered!
