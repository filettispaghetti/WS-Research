'Item: She is not to be kissed fasting in respect
of her breath.'
LAUNCE
Well, that fault may be mended with a breakfast. Read on.
SPEED
'Item: She hath a sweet mouth.'
LAUNCE
That makes amends for her sour breath.
SPEED
'Item: She doth talk in her sleep.'
LAUNCE
It's no matter for that, so she sleep not in her talk.
SPEED
'Item: She is slow in words.'
LAUNCE
O villain, that set this down among her vices! To
be slow in words is a woman's only virtue: I pray
thee, out with't, and place it for her chief virtue.
SPEED
'Item: She is proud.'
LAUNCE
Out with that too; it was Eve's legacy, and cannot
be ta'en from her.
SPEED
'Item: She hath no teeth.'
LAUNCE
I care not for that neither, because I love crusts.
SPEED
'Item: She is curst.'
LAUNCE
Well, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.
SPEED
'Item: She will often praise her liquor.'
LAUNCE
If her liquor be good, she shall: if she will not, I
will; for good things should be praised.
SPEED
'Item: She is too liberal.'
LAUNCE
Of her tongue she cannot, for that's writ down she
is slow of; of her purse she shall not, for that
I'll keep shut: now, of another thing she may, and
that cannot I help. Well, proceed.
SPEED
'Item: She hath more hair than wit, and more faults
than hairs, and more wealth than faults.'
LAUNCE
Stop there; I'll have her: she was mine, and not
mine, twice or thrice in that last article.
