But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,

If ever danger do environ thee,
Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.

And on a love-book pray for my success?
PROTEUS
Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.

And yet you never swum the Hellespont.
PROTEUS
Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.
VALENTINE
No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
PROTEUS
What?
VALENTINE
To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;
Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth
With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:
