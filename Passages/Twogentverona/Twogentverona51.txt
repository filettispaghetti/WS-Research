JULIA
Not a whit, when it jars so.
Host
Hark, what fine change is in the music!
JULIA
Ay, that change is the spite.
Host
You would have them always play but one thing?
JULIA
I would always have one play but one thing.
But, host, doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on
Often resort unto this gentlewoman?
Host
I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he loved
her out of all nick.
JULIA
Where is Launce?
Host
Gone to seek his dog; which tomorrow, by his
master's command, he must carry for a present to his lady.
JULIA
Peace! stand aside: the company parts.
PROTEUS
Sir Thurio, fear not you: I will so plead
That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
THURIO
Where meet we?
PROTEUS
At Saint Gregory's well.
THURIO
Farewell.
Exeunt THURIO and Musicians

Enter SILVIA above

PROTEUS
Madam, good even to your ladyship.
SILVIA
I thank you for your music, gentlemen.
Who is that that spake?
PROTEUS
One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,
You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.
SILVIA
Sir Proteus, as I take it.
PROTEUS
Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.
SILVIA
What's your will?
PROTEUS
