Go get you gone, and let the papers lie:
You would be fingering them, to anger me.
LUCETTA
She makes it strange; but she would be best pleased
To be so anger'd with another letter.
Exit

JULIA
Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!
O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia!
As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed
Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd;
And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
Till I have found each letter in the letter,
Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
And throw it thence into the raging sea!
Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,
'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
To the sweet Julia:' that I'll tear away.
And yet I will not, sith so prettily
He couples it to his complaining names.
Thus will I fold them one on another:
Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
Re-enter LUCETTA

LUCETTA
Madam,
Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
JULIA
Well, let us go.
LUCETTA
What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?
JULIA
If you respect them, best to take them up.
LUCETTA
Nay, I was taken up for laying them down:
Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.
JULIA
