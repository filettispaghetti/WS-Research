and my staff understands me.
SPEED
It stands under thee, indeed.
LAUNCE
Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one.
SPEED
But tell me true, will't be a match?
LAUNCE
Ask my dog: if he say ay, it will! if he say no,
it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.
SPEED
The conclusion is then that it will.
LAUNCE
Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.
SPEED
'Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how sayest
thou, that my master is become a notable lover?
LAUNCE
I never knew him otherwise.
SPEED
Than how?
LAUNCE
A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.
SPEED
Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me.
LAUNCE
Why, fool, I meant not thee; I meant thy master.
SPEED
I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.
LAUNCE
Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn himself
in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse;
if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the
name of a Christian.
SPEED
Why?
LAUNCE
Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to
go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?
SPEED
At thy service.

PROTEUS
To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;
To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;
To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;
