Tell him my fury shall abate, and I the crowns will take.
French Soldier
Petit monsieur, que dit-il?
Boy
Encore qu'il est contre son jurement de pardonner
aucun prisonnier, neanmoins, pour les ecus que vous
l'avez promis, il est content de vous donner la
liberte, le franchisement.
French Soldier
Sur mes genoux je vous donne mille remercimens; et
je m'estime heureux que je suis tombe entre les
mains d'un chevalier, je pense, le plus brave,
vaillant, et tres distingue seigneur d'Angleterre.
PISTOL
Expound unto me, boy.
Boy
He gives you, upon his knees, a thousand thanks; and
he esteems himself happy that he hath fallen into
the hands of one, as he thinks, the most brave,
valorous, and thrice-worthy signieur of England.
PISTOL
As I suck blood, I will some mercy show.
Follow me!
Boy
Suivez-vous le grand capitaine.
Exeunt PISTOL, and French Soldier

I did never know so full a voice issue from so
empty a heart: but the saying is true 'The empty
vessel makes the greatest sound.' Bardolph and Nym
had ten times more valour than this roaring devil i'
the old play, that every one may pare his nails with
a wooden dagger; and they are both hanged; and so
would this be, if he durst steal any thing
adventurously. I must stay with the lackeys, with
the luggage of our camp: the French might have a
good prey of us, if he knew of it; for there is
none to guard it but boys.
Exit

SCENE V. Another part of the field.

Enter Constable, ORLEANS, BOURBON, DAUPHIN, and RAMBURES
Constable
O diable!
ORLEANS
O seigneur! le jour est perdu, tout est perdu!
DAUPHIN
Mort de ma vie! all is confounded, all!
Reproach and everlasting shame
