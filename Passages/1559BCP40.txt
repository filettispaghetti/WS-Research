Suffer little children to come vnto me, and forbid
them not, for to such belongeth the Kyngdome of God. Verily,
I say vnto you; whosoeuer doeth not receiue the Kingdome of
God a# a liytle child, hee shall not enter therein. And when
hee had taken the vp in hi# arme#, hee put hi# hande# vpon
them, and blessed them.
Mar.10.13
¶ After the Goſpel is read, the Minier al make this briefe exhortation
vpon the words of the Goſpel.
Riend#, ye heare in thi# Gospel the word# of our
Sauiour Christ, that he commaunded the children
to be brought vnto him: how he blamed those that
woulde haue kepte them from him: how he
exhorted all men to follow their innocencie. You
perceiue how by hi# outward gesture and deede he declared hi#
good will toward them: for he embraced them in hi# arme#, he
laied hi# hand# vpon them, and blessed them, Doubt yee not
therfore, but ernestly beleeue that he will likewise fauourably
receiue these present Infant#, that hee will embrace them with
the arme# of hi# mercie, that hee will giue vnto them the
blessing of eternal life: and make them partaker# of hi# euerlasting
Kingdome. Wherfore we being thu# perswaded of the
good will of our heauenly father, towarde# these Infant#
declared by hi# Sonne Jesu# Christ, and nothing doubting, 
but that hee fauourably alloweth thi# charitable worke of our#,
in bringing these children to hi# holye Baptisme: let v# faithfully
and deuoutly giue thanke# vnto him, and say,
Lmighty and euerlasting God, heauenly Father,
we giue thee humble thank#, that thou hast vouchsaufed
to call v# to the knowledge of thy grace
and faith in thee: Increase thi# knowledge, and
confirme thi# faith in v# euermore: Giue thy holy
Spirit to these infant#, that they may be borne againe, and be
made heire# of euerlasting Saluacion, through our Lord Jesu#
Christ, who liueth and reigneth with thee and the holy Spirit,
now and for euer. Amen.
¶ Then the Prie al ſpeake vnto the Godfathers and Godmothers, on this
wyſe:
Elbeloued friend#, yee haue brought these children
here to bee baptized, ye haue prayed that our Lord
Jesu# Christ, would vouchsafe to receiue them, to
lay hi# hand# vpon them, to blesse them, to release
them of their sinne#, to giue them the Kingdome of heauen,
and euerlasting life. Yee haue heard also that our Lord Jesu#
Christ hath promised in hi# Gospel, to grant all these thing#
that ye haue prayed for: which promise he for hi# part will
most surely keepe and performe. Wherfore after thi# promise
made by Christ, these infant# must also faithfully for their part
promise by you that be their suretie#, that they will forsake the
deuill and all his worke#, and constantly beleeue God# holy
