Job 39:19	Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?
Job 39:20	Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.
Job 39:21	He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.
Job 39:22	He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.
Job 39:23	The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.
Job 39:24	He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.
Job 39:25	He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
Job 39:26	Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?
Job 39:27	Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?
Job 39:28	She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.
Job 39:29	From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.
Job 39:30	Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.
Job 40:1	Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,
Job 40:2	Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.
Job 40:3	Then Job answered the LORD, and said,
Job 40:4	Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.
Job 40:5	Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.
Job 40:6	Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
Job 40:7	Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
Job 40:8	Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?
Job 40:9	Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
Job 40:10	Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.
Job 40:11	Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.
Job 40:12	Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.
Job 40:13	Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.
Job 40:14	Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.
Job 40:15	Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.
Job 40:16	Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.
Job 40:17	He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.
Job 40:18	His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.
Job 40:19	He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.
Job 40:20	Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.
Job 40:21	He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.
Job 40:22	The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.
Job 40:23	Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
Job 40:24	He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.
Job 41:1	Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?
Job 41:2	Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
Job 41:3	Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?
Job 41:4	Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?
Job 41:5	Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
Job 41:6	Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?
Job 41:7	Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?
Job 41:8	Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.
Job 41:9	Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?
Job 41:10	None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?
Job 41:11	Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.
Job 41:12	I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.
