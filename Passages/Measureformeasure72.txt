DUKE VINCENTIO
Are you a maid?
MARIANA
No, my lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO
A widow, then?
MARIANA
Neither, my lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?
LUCIO
My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are
neither maid, widow, nor wife.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause
To prattle for himself.
LUCIO
Well, my lord.
MARIANA
My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;
And I confess besides I am no maid:
I have known my husband; yet my husband
Knows not that ever he knew me.
LUCIO
He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.
DUKE VINCENTIO
For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!
LUCIO
Well, my lord.
DUKE VINCENTIO
This is no witness for Lord Angelo.
MARIANA
Now I come to't my lord
She that accuses him of fornication,
In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,
And charges him my lord, with such a time
When I'll depose I had him in mine arms
With all the effect of love.
ANGELO
Charges she more than me?
MARIANA
Not that I know.
DUKE VINCENTIO
No? you say your husband.
MARIANA
Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.
ANGELO
This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.
