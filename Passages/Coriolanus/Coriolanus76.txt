A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him
out of the house: prithee, call my master to him.
Retires

Third Servingman
What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid
the house.
CORIOLANUS
Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.
Third Servingman
What are you?
CORIOLANUS
A gentleman.
Third Servingman
A marvellous poor one.
CORIOLANUS
True, so I am.
Third Servingman
Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other
station; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.
CORIOLANUS
Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.
Pushes him away

Third Servingman
What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a
strange guest he has here.
Second Servingman
And I shall.
Exit

Third Servingman
Where dwellest thou?
CORIOLANUS
Under the canopy.
Third Servingman
Under the canopy!
CORIOLANUS
Ay.
Third Servingman
Where's that?
CORIOLANUS
I' the city of kites and crows.
Third Servingman
I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!
Then thou dwellest with daws too?
CORIOLANUS
No, I serve not thy master.
Third Servingman
How, sir! do you meddle with my master?
