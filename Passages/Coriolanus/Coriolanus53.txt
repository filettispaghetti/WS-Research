in whose name myself
Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,
And follow to thine answer.
CORIOLANUS
Hence, old goat!
Senators, & C	We'll surety him.
COMINIUS
Aged sir, hands off.
CORIOLANUS
Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
Out of thy garments.
SICINIUS
Help, ye citizens!
Enter a rabble of Citizens (Plebeians), with the AEdiles

MENENIUS
On both sides more respect.
SICINIUS
Here's he that would take from you all your power.
BRUTUS
Seize him, AEdiles!
Citizens
Down with him! down with him!
Senators, & C	Weapons, weapons, weapons!
They all bustle about CORIOLANUS, crying

'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'
'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'
'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'
MENENIUS
What is about to be? I am out of breath;
Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes
To the people! Coriolanus, patience!
Speak, good Sicinius.
SICINIUS
Hear me, people; peace!
Citizens
Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
SICINIUS
You are at point to lose your liberties:
Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
Whom late you have named for consul.
MENENIUS
Fie, fie, fie!
This is the way to kindle, not to quench.
First Senator
To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.
SICINIUS
