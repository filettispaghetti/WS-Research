Re-enter a third Citizen

You know the cause, air, of my standing here.
Third Citizen
We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.
CORIOLANUS
Mine own desert.
Second Citizen
Your own desert!
CORIOLANUS
Ay, but not mine own desire.
Third Citizen
How not your own desire?
CORIOLANUS
No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the
poor with begging.
Third Citizen
You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to
gain by you.
CORIOLANUS
Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?
First Citizen
The price is to ask it kindly.
CORIOLANUS
Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to
show you, which shall be yours in private. Your
good voice, sir; what say you?
Second Citizen
You shall ha' it, worthy sir.
CORIOLANUS
A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices
begged. I have your alms: adieu.
Third Citizen
But this is something odd.
Second Citizen
An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.
Exeunt the three Citizens

Re-enter two other Citizens

CORIOLANUS
Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your
voices that I may be consul, I have here the
customary gown.
Fourth Citizen
You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
have not deserved nobly.
CORIOLANUS
Your enigma?
Fourth Citizen
