another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one
at home for you.
MENENIUS
I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for
me!
VIRGILIA
Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.
MENENIUS
A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven
years' health; in which time I will make a lip at
the physician: the most sovereign prescription in
Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,
of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he
not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.
VIRGILIA
O, no, no, no.
VOLUMNIA
O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.
MENENIUS
So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'
victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.
VOLUMNIA
On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home
with the oaken garland.
MENENIUS
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
VOLUMNIA
Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but
Aufidius got off.
MENENIUS
And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:
an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so
fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold
that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?
VOLUMNIA
Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate
has letters from the general, wherein he gives my
son the whole name of the war: he hath in this
action outdone his former deeds doubly
VALERIA
In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
MENENIUS
Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his
true purchasing.
VIRGILIA
The gods grant them true!
VOLUMNIA
True! pow, wow.
MENENIUS
True! I'll be sworn they are true.
