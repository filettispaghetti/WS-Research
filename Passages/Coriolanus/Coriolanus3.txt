it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
content to say it was for his country he did it to
please his mother and to be partly proud; which he
is, even till the altitude of his virtue.
Second Citizen
What he cannot help in his nature, you account a
vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.
First Citizen
If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;
he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.
Shouts within

What shouts are these? The other side o' the city
is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!
All
Come, come.
First Citizen
Soft! who comes here?
Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA

Second Citizen
Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved
the people.
First Citizen
He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!
MENENIUS
What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you
With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.
First Citizen
Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,
which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor
suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we
have strong arms too.
MENENIUS
Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
Will you undo yourselves?
First Citizen
We cannot, sir, we are undone already.
MENENIUS
I tell you, friends, most charitable care
Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
Against the Roman state, whose course will on
The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
Of more strong link asunder than can ever
Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
