That made the air unwholesome, when you cast
Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;
And not a hair upon a soldier's head
Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs
As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
if he could burn us all into one coal,
We have deserved it.
Citizens
Faith, we hear fearful news.
First Citizen
For mine own part,
When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.
Second Citizen
And so did I.
Third Citizen
And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very
many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and
though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet
it was against our will.
COMINIUS
Ye re goodly things, you voices!
MENENIUS
You have made
Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?
COMINIUS
O, ay, what else?
Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS

SICINIUS
Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:
These are a side that would be glad to have
This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
And show no sign of fear.
First Citizen
The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.
I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished
him.
Second Citizen
So did we all. But, come, let's home.
Exeunt Citizens

BRUTUS
I do not like this news.
SICINIUS
Nor I.
BRUTUS
Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
Would buy this for a lie!
