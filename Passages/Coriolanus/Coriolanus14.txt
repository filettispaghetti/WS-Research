were sensible as your finger, that you might leave
pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.
VIRGILIA
No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.
VALERIA
In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you
excellent news of your husband.
VIRGILIA
O, good madam, there can be none yet.
VALERIA
Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from
him last night.
VIRGILIA
Indeed, madam?
VALERIA
In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.
Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against
whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of
our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set
down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt
prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,
on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.
VIRGILIA
Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every
thing hereafter.
VOLUMNIA
Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but
disease our better mirth.
VALERIA
In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.
Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy
solemness out o' door. and go along with us.
VIRGILIA
No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wish
you much mirth.
VALERIA
Well, then, farewell.
Exeunt
