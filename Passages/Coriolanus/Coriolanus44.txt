SICINIUS
How now, my masters! have you chose this man?
First Citizen
He has our voices, sir.
BRUTUS
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
Second Citizen
Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,
He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.
Third Citizen
Certainly
He flouted us downright.
First Citizen
No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.
Second Citizen
Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us
His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.
SICINIUS
Why, so he did, I am sure.
Citizens
No, no; no man saw 'em.
Third Citizen
He said he had wounds, which he could show
in private;
And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,
But by your voices, will not so permit me;
Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:
Your most sweet voices: now you have left
your voices,
I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?
SICINIUS
Why either were you ignorant to see't,
Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
To yield your voices?
BRUTUS
Could you not have told him
As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,
But was a petty servant to the state,
He was your enemy, ever spake against
Your liberties and the charters that you bear
I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving
A place of potency and sway o' the state,
If he should still malignantly remain
Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might
Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
