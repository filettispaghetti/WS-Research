MARCIUS
Say, has our general met the enemy?
Messenger
They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.
LARTIUS
So, the good horse is mine.
MARCIUS
I'll buy him of you.
LARTIUS
No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will
For half a hundred years. Summon the town.
MARCIUS
How far off lie these armies?
Messenger
Within this mile and half.
MARCIUS
Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
That we with smoking swords may march from hence,
To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
They sound a parley. Enter two Senators with others on the walls

Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?
First Senator
No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
That's lesser than a little.
Drums afar off

Hark! our drums
Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,
Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,
Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;
They'll open of themselves.
Alarum afar off

Hark you. far off!
There is Aufidius; list, what work he makes
Amongst your cloven army.
MARCIUS
O, they are at it!
LARTIUS
Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!
Enter the army of the Volsces

MARCIUS
They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
brave Titus:
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
