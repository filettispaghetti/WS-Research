Where is he wounded?
To the Tribunes

God save your good worships! Marcius is coming
home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?
VOLUMNIA
I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be
large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall
stand for his place. He received in the repulse of
Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.
MENENIUS
One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's
nine that I know.
VOLUMNIA
He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five
wounds upon him.
MENENIUS
Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.
A shout and flourish

Hark! the trumpets.
VOLUMNIA
These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he
carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the general, and TITUS LARTIUS; between them, CORIOLANUS, crowned with an oaken garland; with Captains and Soldiers, and a Herald

Herald
Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight
Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,
With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these
In honour follows Coriolanus.
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
Flourish

All
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
CORIOLANUS
No more of this; it does offend my heart:
Pray now, no more.
COMINIUS
Look, sir, your mother!
CORIOLANUS
O,
You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
For my prosperity!
Kneels
