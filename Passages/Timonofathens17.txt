First Lord
I am so far already in your gifts,--
All
So are we all.
Enter a Servant

Servant
My lord, there are certain nobles of the senate
Newly alighted, and come to visit you.
TIMON
They are fairly welcome.
FLAVIUS
I beseech your honour,
Vouchsafe me a word; it does concern you near.
TIMON
Near! why then, another time I'll hear thee:
I prithee, let's be provided to show them
entertainment.
FLAVIUS
[Aside] I scarce know how.
Enter a Second Servant

Second Servant
May it please your honour, Lord Lucius,
Out of his free love, hath presented to you
Four milk-white horses, trapp'd in silver.
TIMON
I shall accept them fairly; let the presents
Be worthily entertain'd.
Enter a third Servant

How now! what news?
Third Servant
Please you, my lord, that honourable
gentleman, Lord Lucullus, entreats your company
to-morrow to hunt with him, and has sent your honour
two brace of greyhounds.
TIMON
I'll hunt with him; and let them be received,
Not without fair reward.
FLAVIUS
[Aside] What will this come to?
He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,
And all out of an empty coffer:
Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,
To show him what a beggar his heart is,
Being of no power to make his wishes good:
His promises fly so beyond his state
That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes
For every word: he is so kind that he now
