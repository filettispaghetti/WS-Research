[Flourish. Enter Theseus, Hippolyta,
Emilia, Pirithous, and some Attendants.]


EMILIA
I'll no step further.

PIRITHOUS  Will you lose this sight?

EMILIA
I had rather see a wren hawk at a fly
Than this decision; ev'ry blow that falls
Threats a brave life; each stroke laments
The place whereon it falls, and sounds more like
A bell than blade. I will stay here.
It is enough my hearing shall be punished
With what shall happen, 'gainst the which there is
No deafing but to hear; not taint mine eye
With dread sights it may shun.

PIRITHOUS, [to Theseus]  Sir, my good lord,
Your sister will no further.

THESEUS  O, she must.
She shall see deeds of honor in their kind,
Which sometime show well, penciled. Nature now
Shall make and act the story, the belief
Both sealed with eye and ear.--You must be present;
You are the victor's meed, the price and garland
To crown the question's title.

EMILIA  Pardon me.
If I were there, I'd wink.

THESEUS  You must be there;
This trial is as 'twere i' th' night, and you
The only star to shine.

EMILIA  I am extinct;
There is but envy in that light which shows
The one the other. Darkness, which ever was
The dam of horror, who does stand accursed
Of many mortal millions, may even now,
By casting her black mantle over both,
That neither could find other, get herself
Some part of a good name, and many a murder
Set off whereto she's guilty.

HIPPOLYTA  You must go.
