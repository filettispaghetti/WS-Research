For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.
KING EDWARD IV
But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,
Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York.
Mayor
True, my good lord; I know you for no less.
KING EDWARD IV
Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,
As being well content with that alone.
GLOUCESTER
[Aside] But when the fox hath once got in his nose,
He'll soon find means to make the body follow.
HASTINGS
Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
Mayor
Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.
They descend

GLOUCESTER
A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!
HASTINGS
The good old man would fain that all were well,
So 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd,
I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade
Both him and all his brothers unto reason.
Enter the Mayor and two Aldermen, below

KING EDWARD IV
So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut
But in the night or in the time of war.
What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;
Takes his keys

For Edward will defend the town and thee,
And all those friends that deign to follow me.
March. Enter MONTGOMERY, with drum and soldiers

GLOUCESTER
Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,
Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived.
KING EDWARD IV
Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?
MONTAGUE
To help King Edward in his time of storm,
As every loyal subject ought to do.
KING EDWARD IV
Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
Our title to the crown and only claim
Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.
