Regard thy danger, and along with me!
VALENTINE
I pray thee, Launce, an if thou seest my boy,
Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate.
PROTEUS
Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine.
VALENTINE
O my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!
Exeunt VALENTINE and PROTEUS

LAUNCE
I am but a fool, look you; and yet I have the wit to
think my master is a kind of a knave: but that's
all one, if he be but one knave. He lives not now
that knows me to be in love; yet I am in love; but a
team of horse shall not pluck that from me; nor who
'tis I love; and yet 'tis a woman; but what woman, I
will not tell myself; and yet 'tis a milkmaid; yet
'tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips; yet 'tis
a maid, for she is her master's maid, and serves for
wages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel;
which is much in a bare Christian.
Pulling out a paper

Here is the cate-log of her condition.
'Imprimis: She can fetch and carry.' Why, a horse
can do no more: nay, a horse cannot fetch, but only
carry; therefore is she better than a jade. 'Item:
She can milk;' look you, a sweet virtue in a maid
with clean hands.

SPEED
How now, Signior Launce! what news with your
mastership?
LAUNCE
With my master's ship? why, it is at sea.
SPEED
Well, your old vice still; mistake the word. What
news, then, in your paper?
LAUNCE
The blackest news that ever thou heardest.
SPEED
Why, man, how black?
LAUNCE
Why, as black as ink.
SPEED
Let me read them.
LAUNCE
Fie on thee, jolt-head! thou canst not read.
