A purple flower sprung up, checkered with white,
  Resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood
  Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.

She bows her head the new-sprung flower to smell,
Comparing it to her Adonis' breath,
And says within her bosom it shall dwell,
Since he himself is reft from her by death.
  She crops the stalk, and in the breach appears
  Green-dropping sap, which she compares to tears.

"Poor flower," quoth she, "this was thy father's guise--
Sweet issue of a more sweet-smelling sire--
For every little grief to wet his eyes;
To grow unto himself was his desire,
  And so 'tis thine, but know it is as good
  To wither in my breast as in his blood.

"Here was thy father's bed, here in my breast;
Thou art the next of blood, and 'tis thy right.
Lo, in this hollow cradle take thy rest;
My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night.
  There shall not be one minute in an hour
  Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love's flower."

Thus, weary of the world, away she hies
And yokes her silver doves, by whose swift aid
Their mistress mounted through the empty skies
In her light chariot quickly is conveyed,
  Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen
  Means to immure herself and not be seen.
