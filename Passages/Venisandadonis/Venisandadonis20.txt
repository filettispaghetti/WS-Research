"As burning fevers, agues pale and faint,
Life-poisoning pestilence and frenzies wood,
The marrow-eating sickness, whose attaint
Disorder breeds by heating of the blood;
  Surfeits, impostumes, grief, and damned despair
  Swear Nature's death for framing thee so fair.

"And not the least of all these maladies
But in one minute's fight brings beauty under.
Both favor, savor, hew, and qualities,
Whereat th' impartial gazer late did wonder,
  Are on the sudden wasted, thawed, and done,
  As mountain snow melts with the midday sun.

"Therefore, despite of fruitless chastity,
Love-lacking vestals and self-loving nuns,
That on the Earth would breed a scarcity
And barren dearth of daughters and of sons,
  Be prodigal. The lamp that burns by night
  Dries up his oil to lend the world his light.

"What is thy body but a swallowing grave
Seeming to bury that posterity
Which by the rights of time thou needs must have
If thou destroy them not in dark obscurity?
  If so, the world will hold thee in disdain
  Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain.

"So in thyself thyself art made away,
A mischief worse than civil homebred strife,
Or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay,
Or butcher sire that reaves his son of life.
  Foul cank'ring rust the hidden treasure frets,
  But gold that's put to use more gold begets."

"Nay, then," quoth Adon, "you will fall again
Into your idle over-handled theme.
The kiss I gave you is bestowed in vain,
And all in vain you strive against the stream,
  For, by this black-faced night, desire's foul nurse,
  Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.

"If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues,
And every tongue more moving than your own,
Bewitching like the wanton mermaids' songs,
Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown;
  For know my heart stands armed in mine ear
  And will not let a false sound enter there,

"Lest the deceiving harmony should run
