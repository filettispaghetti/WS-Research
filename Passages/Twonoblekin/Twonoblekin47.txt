perfumes.
I'll come again some two hours hence and bring
That that shall quiet all.

PALAMON  A sword and armor.

ARCITE
Fear me not. You are now too foul. Farewell.
Get off your trinkets; you shall want naught.

PALAMON  Sirrah--

ARCITE
I'll hear no more.
[He exits.]

PALAMON  If he keep touch, he dies for 't.
[He exits.]

Scene 4
=======
[Enter Jailer's Daughter.]


DAUGHTER
I am very cold, and all the stars are out too,
The little stars and all, that look like aglets.
The sun has seen my folly.--Palamon!
Alas, no; he's in heaven. Where am I now?
Yonder's the sea, and there's a ship. How 't tumbles!
And there's a rock lies watching under water.
Now, now, it beats upon it; now, now, now,
There's a leak sprung, a sound one! How they cry!
Open her before the wind; you'll lose all else.
Up with a course or two, and tack about, boys!
Good night, good night; you're gone. I am very
hungry.
Would I could find a fine frog; he would tell me
News from all parts o' th' world; then would I make
A carrack of a cockleshell, and sail
By east and northeast to the king of pygmies,
For he tells fortunes rarely. Now my father,
Twenty to one, is trussed up in a trice
Tomorrow morning. I'll say never a word.
[Sing.]
	For I'll cut my green coat a foot above my knee,
	And I'll clip my yellow locks an inch below mine
eye.
	   Hey nonny, nonny, nonny.
	He's buy me a white cut, forth for to ride,
