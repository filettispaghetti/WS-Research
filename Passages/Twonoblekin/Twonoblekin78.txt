whole million of cutpurses, and there boil like a
gammon of bacon that will never be enough.

DOCTOR  How her brains coins!

DAUGHTER  Lords and courtiers that have got maids
with child, they are in this place. They shall stand
in fire up to the navel and in ice up to th' heart, and
there th' offending part burns and the deceiving
part freezes: in troth, a very grievous punishment,
as one would think, for such a trifle. Believe me,
one would marry a leprous witch to be rid on 't, I'll
assure you.

DOCTOR  How she continues this fancy! 'Tis not an engraffed
madness, but a most thick and profound
melancholy.

DAUGHTER  To hear there a proud lady and a proud city
wife howl together--I were a beast an I'd call it
good sport. One cries "O this smoke!" th' other,
"This fire!"; one cries, "O, that ever I did it behind
the arras!" and then howls; th' other curses a suing
fellow and her garden house.
[Sings.]
I will be true, my stars, my fate, etc.
[Daughter exits.]

JAILER  What think you of her, sir?

DOCTOR  I think she has a perturbed mind, which I
cannot minister to.

JAILER  Alas, what then?

DOCTOR  Understand you she ever affected any man
ere she beheld Palamon?

JAILER  I was once, sir, in great hope she had fixed her
liking on this gentleman, my friend.

WOOER  I did think so, too, and would account I had a
great penn'orth on 't to give half my state that both
she and I, at this present, stood unfeignedly on the
same terms.

DOCTOR  That intemp'rate surfeit of her eye hath distempered
the other senses. They may return and
settle again to execute their preordained faculties,
but they are now in a most extravagant vagary.
