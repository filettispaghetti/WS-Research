
JAILER  He's a very fair one.

DAUGHTER
You never saw him dance?

JAILER  No.

DAUGHTER  I have, often.
He dances very finely, very comely,
And for a jig, come cut and long tail to him,
He turns you like a top.

JAILER  That's fine indeed.

DAUGHTER
He'll dance the morris twenty mile an hour,
And that will founder the best hobbyhorse,
If I have any skill, in all the parish,
And gallops to the tune of "Light o' love."
What think you of this horse?

JAILER  Having these virtues,
I think he might be brought to play at tennis.

DAUGHTER
Alas, that's nothing.

JAILER  Can he write and read too?

DAUGHTER
A very fair hand, and casts himself th' accounts
Of all his hay and provender. That hostler
Must rise betime that cozens him. You know
The chestnut mare the Duke has?

JAILER  Very well.

DAUGHTER
She is horribly in love with him, poor beast,
But he is like his master, coy and scornful.

JAILER
What dowry has she?

DAUGHTER  Some two hundred bottles,
And twenty strike of oats, but he'll ne'er have her.
He lisps in 's neighing able to entice
A miller's mare. He'll be the death of her.
