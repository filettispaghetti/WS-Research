Convent in their behoof; our richest balms,
Rather than niggard, waste. Their lives concern us
Much more than Thebes is worth. Rather than have
'em
Freed of this plight, and in their morning state,
Sound and at liberty, I would 'em dead.
But forty-thousandfold we had rather have 'em
Prisoners to us than Death. Bear 'em speedily
From our kind air, to them unkind, and minister
What man to man may do--for our sake, more,
Since I have known frights, fury, friends' behests,
Love's provocations, zeal, a mistress' task,
Desire of liberty, a fever, madness,
Hath set a mark which nature could not reach to
Without some imposition, sickness in will
O'er-wrestling strength in reason. For our love
And great Apollo's mercy, all our best
Their best skill tender.--Lead into the city,
Where, having bound things scattered, we will post
To Athens 'fore our army.
[Flourish. They exit.]

Scene 5
=======
[Music. Enter the Queens with the hearses of their
knights, in a funeral solemnity, &c.]

The dirge.

	   Urns and odors bring away;
	   Vapors, sighs, darken the day;
	Our dole more deadly looks than dying;
	   Balms and gums and heavy cheers,
	   Sacred vials filled with tears,
	And clamors through the wild air flying.
	   Come, all sad and solemn shows
	   That are quick-eyed Pleasure's foes;
	   We convent naught else but woes.
	   We convent naught else but woes.

THIRD QUEEN, [to Second Queen]
This funeral path brings to your household's grave.
Joy seize on you again; peace sleep with him.

SECOND QUEEN, [to First Queen]
And this to yours.

FIRST QUEEN, [to Third Queen]  Yours this way. Heavens
lend
A thousand differing ways to one sure end.
