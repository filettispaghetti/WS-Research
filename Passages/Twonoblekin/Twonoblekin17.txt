Friend thee forever.

THIRD QUEEN  All the good that may
Be wished upon thy head, I cry "Amen" to 't!

THESEUS
Th' impartial gods, who from the mounted heavens
View us their mortal herd, behold who err
And, in their time, chastise. Go and find out
The bones of your dead lords and honor them
With treble ceremony; rather than a gap
Should be in their dear rites, we would supply 't;
But those we will depute which shall invest
You in your dignities and even each thing
Our haste does leave imperfect. So, adieu,
And heaven's good eyes look on you.	[Queens exit.]

[Enter a Herald and Soldiers bearing Palamon
and Arcite on biers.]

What are those?

HERALD
Men of great quality, as may be judged
By their appointment. Some of Thebes have told 's
They are sisters' children, nephews to the King.

THESEUS
By th' helm of Mars, I saw them in the war,
Like to a pair of lions, smeared with prey,
Make lanes in troops aghast. I fixed my note
Constantly on them, for they were a mark
Worth a god's view. What prisoner was 't that told me
When I enquired their names?

HERALD  Wi' leave, they're called
Arcite and Palamon.

THESEUS  'Tis right; those, those.
They are not dead?

HERALD
Nor in a state of life. Had they been taken
When their last hurts were given, 'twas possible
They might have been recovered. Yet they breathe
And have the name of men.

THESEUS  Then like men use 'em.
The very lees of such, millions of rates,
Exceed the wine of others. All our surgeons
