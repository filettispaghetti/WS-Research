
ALL KNIGHTS  Commend us to her.
[They give their purses.]

JAILER
The gods requite you all and make her thankful!

PALAMON
Adieu, and let my life be now as short
As my leave-taking.	[Lays his head on the block.]

FIRST KNIGHT  Lead, courageous cousin.

SECOND AND THIRD KNIGHTS  We'll follow cheerfully.

[A great noise within crying "Run!" "Save!" "Hold!"
Enter in haste a Messenger.]


MESSENGER
Hold, hold! O, hold, hold, hold!

[Enter Pirithous in haste.]


PIRITHOUS
Hold, ho! It is a cursed haste you made
If you have done so quickly!--Noble Palamon,
The gods will show their glory in a life
That thou art yet to lead.

PALAMON  Can that be,
When Venus, I have said, is false? How do things
fare?

PIRITHOUS
Arise, great sir, and give the tidings ear
That are most dearly sweet and bitter.

PALAMON, [rising]  What
Hath waked us from our dream?

PIRITHOUS  List then: your
cousin,
Mounted upon a steed that Emily
Did first bestow on him--a black one, owing
Not a hair worth of white, which some will say
Weakens his price, and many will not buy
His goodness with this note, which superstition
Here finds allowance--on this horse is Arcite
