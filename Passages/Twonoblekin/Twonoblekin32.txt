Thou hast the start now; thou shalt stay and see
Her bright eyes break each morning 'gainst thy
window
And let in life into thee; thou shalt feed
Upon the sweetness of a noble beauty
That nature ne'er exceeded nor ne'er shall.
Good gods, what happiness has Palamon!
Twenty to one he'll come to speak to her,
And if she be as gentle as she's fair,
I know she's his. He has a tongue will tame
Tempests and make the wild rocks wanton.
Come what can come,
The worst is death. I will not leave the kingdom.
I know mine own is but a heap of ruins,
And no redress there. If I go, he has her.
I am resolved another shape shall make me
Or end my fortunes. Either way I am happy.
I'll see her and be near her, or no more.

[Enter four Country people, and one with
a garland before them.]

[Arcite steps aside.]

FIRST COUNTRYMAN  My masters, I'll be there, that's
certain.

SECOND COUNTRYMAN  And I'll be there.

THIRD COUNTRYMAN  And I.

FOURTH COUNTRYMAN  Why, then, have with you, boys.
'Tis but a chiding. Let the plough play today; I'll
tickle 't out of the jades' tails tomorrow.

FIRST COUNTRYMAN  I am sure to have my wife as jealous
as a turkey, but that's all one. I'll go through;
let her mumble.

SECOND COUNTRYMAN  Clap her aboard tomorrow night
and stow her, and all's made up again.

THIRD COUNTRYMAN  Ay, do but put a fescue in her fist
and you shall see her take a new lesson out and be
a good wench. Do we all hold against the Maying?

FOURTH COUNTRYMAN  Hold? What should ail us?

THIRD COUNTRYMAN  Arcas will be there.
