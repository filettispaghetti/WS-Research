
DOCTOR  Go, go.
You fathers are fine fools. Her honesty?
And we should give her physic till we find that!

WOOER
Why, do you think she is not honest, sir?

DOCTOR
How old is she?

WOOER  She's eighteen.

DOCTOR  She may be.
But that's all one; 'tis nothing to our purpose.
Whate'er her father says, if you perceive
Her mood inclining that way that I spoke of,
Videlicet, the way of flesh--you have me?

WOOER
Yes, very well, sir.

DOCTOR  Please her appetite,
And do it home; it cures her, ipso facto,
The melancholy humor that infects her.

WOOER
I am of your mind, doctor.

DOCTOR  You'll find it so.

[Enter Jailer, Daughter, and Maid.]

She comes; pray humor her.
[Wooer and Doctor stand aside.]

JAILER, [to Daughter]
Come, your love Palamon stays for you, child,
And has done this long hour, to visit you.

DAUGHTER
I thank him for his gentle patience.
He's a kind gentleman, and I am much bound to
him.
Did you ne'er see the horse he gave me?

JAILER  Yes.

DAUGHTER
How do you like him?
