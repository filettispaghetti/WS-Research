now?

THIRD COUNTRYMAN  What shall we determine, sir?

SCHOOLMASTER  Nothing. Our business is become a
nullity, yea, and a woeful and a piteous nullity.

FOURTH COUNTRYMAN  Now, when the credit of our town
lay on it, now to be frampold, now to piss o' th'
nettle! Go thy ways; I'll remember thee. I'll fit
thee!

[Enter Jailer's Daughter.]


DAUGHTER, [sings]
	The George Alow came from the south,
	From the coast of Barbary-a,
	And there he met with brave gallants of war,
	By one, by two, by three-a.
	"Well hailed, well hailed, you jolly gallants,
	And whither now are you bound-a?
	O, let me have your company
	Till I come to the sound-a."
There was three fools, fell out about an owlet--
[Sings] 	The one he said it was an owl,
	   The other he said nay,
	The third he said it was a hawk,
	   And her bells were cut away.

THIRD COUNTRYMAN  There's a dainty madwoman, master,
comes i' th' nick, as mad as a March hare. If we
can get her dance, we are made again. I warrant
her, she'll do the rarest gambols.

FIRST COUNTRYMAN  A madwoman? We are made, boys.

SCHOOLMASTER, [to Jailer's Daughter]  And are you mad,
good woman?

DAUGHTER  I would be sorry else. Give me your hand.

SCHOOLMASTER  Why?

DAUGHTER  I can tell your fortune. [She looks at his
hand.] You are a fool. Tell ten.--I have posed him.
Buzz!--Friend, you must eat no white bread; if
you do, your teeth will bleed extremely. Shall we
dance, ho? I know you, you're a tinker. Sirrah tinker,
stop no more holes but what you should.
