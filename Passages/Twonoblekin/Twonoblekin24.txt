
PALAMON
I do not think it possible our friendship
Should ever leave us.

ARCITE  Till our deaths it cannot.

[Enter Emilia and her Woman, below.]

And after death our spirits shall be led
To those that love eternally.	[Palamon catches sight
of Emilia.]
Speak on, sir.

EMILIA, [to her Woman]
This garden has a world of pleasures in 't.
What flower is this?

WOMAN  'Tis called narcissus, madam.

EMILIA
That was a fair boy certain, but a fool
To love himself. Were there not maids enough?

ARCITE, [to Palamon, who is stunned by the sight of Emilia]
Pray, forward.

PALAMON  Yes.

EMILIA, [to Woman]  Or were they all hard-hearted?

WOMAN
They could not be to one so fair.

EMILIA  Thou wouldst not.

WOMAN
I think I should not, madam.

EMILIA  That's a good wench.
But take heed to your kindness, though.

WOMAN  Why,
madam?

EMILIA
Men are mad things.

ARCITE, [to Palamon]  Will you go forward,
cousin?
