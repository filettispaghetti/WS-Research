For there the cure lies mainly.

WOOER  Then she told me
She would watch with me tonight, for well she knew
What hour my fit would take me.

DOCTOR  Let her do so,
And when your fit comes, fit her home,
And presently.

WOOER  She would have me sing.

DOCTOR
You did so?

WOOER  No.

DOCTOR  'Twas very ill done, then.
You should observe her ev'ry way.

WOOER  Alas,
I have no voice, sir, to confirm her that way.

DOCTOR
That's all one, if you make a noise.
If she entreat again, do anything.
Lie with her, if she ask you.

JAILER  Ho there, doctor!

DOCTOR
Yes, in the way of cure.

JAILER  But first, by your leave,
I' th' way of honesty.

DOCTOR  That's but a niceness.
Ne'er cast your child away for honesty.
Cure her first this way; then if she will be honest,
She has the path before her.

JAILER
Thank you, doctor.

DOCTOR  Pray bring her in
And let's see how she is.

JAILER  I will, and tell her
Her Palamon stays for her. But, doctor,
Methinks you are i' th' wrong still.	[Jailer exits.]
