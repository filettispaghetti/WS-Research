As for him sorry. O you heavenly charmers,
What things you make of us! For what we lack
We laugh, for what we have are sorry, still
Are children in some kind. Let us be thankful
For that which is, and with you leave dispute
That are above our question. Let's go off
And bear us like the time.

EPILOGUE
I would now ask you how you like the play,
But, as it is with schoolboys, cannot say.
I am cruel fearful! Pray yet, stay a while,
And let me look upon you. No man smile?
Then it goes hard, I see. He that has
Loved a young handsome wench, then, show his
face--
'Tis strange if none be here--and, if he will,
Against his conscience let him hiss and kill
Our market. 'Tis in vain, I see, to stay you.
Have at the worst can come, then! Now what say
you?
And yet mistake me not: I am not bold.
We have no such cause. If the tale we have told--
For 'tis no other--any way content you--
For to that honest purpose it was meant you--
We have our end; and you shall have ere long,
I dare say, many a better, to prolong
Your old loves to us. We, and all our might,
Rest at your service. Gentlemen, good night.
