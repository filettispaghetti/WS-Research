To be one hour at liberty, and grasp
Our good swords in our hands, I would quickly
teach thee
What 'twere to filch affection from another.
Thou art baser in it than a cutpurse.
Put but thy head out of this window more
And, as I have a soul, I'll nail thy life to 't.

ARCITE
Thou dar'st not, fool; thou canst not; thou art feeble.
Put my head out? I'll throw my body out
And leap the garden when I see her next,
And pitch between her arms to anger thee.

[Enter Jailer, above.]


PALAMON
No more; the keeper's coming. I shall live
To knock thy brains out with my shackles.

ARCITE  Do!

JAILER
By your leave, gentlemen.

PALAMON  Now, honest keeper?

JAILER
Lord Arcite, you must presently to th' Duke;
The cause I know not yet.

ARCITE  I am ready, keeper.

JAILER
Prince Palamon, I must awhile bereave you
Of your fair cousin's company.
[Arcite and Jailer exit.]

PALAMON  And me too,
Even when you please, of life.--Why is he sent for?
It may be he shall marry her; he's goodly,
And like enough the Duke hath taken notice
Both of his blood and body. But his falsehood!
Why should a friend be treacherous? If that
Get him a wife so noble and so fair,
Let honest men ne'er love again. Once more
I would but see this fair one. Blessed garden
And fruit and flowers more blessed that still
blossom
