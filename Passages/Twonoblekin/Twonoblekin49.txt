
FOURTH COUNTRYMAN  Here's Fritz and Maudlin.

SECOND COUNTRYMAN  And little Luce with the white
legs, and bouncing Barbary.

FIRST COUNTRYMAN  And freckled Nell, that never failed
her master.

SCHOOLMASTER  Where be your ribbons, maids? Swim
with your bodies, and carry it sweetly and deliverly,
and now and then a favor and a frisk.

NELL  Let us alone, sir.

SCHOOLMASTER  Where's the rest o' th' music?

THIRD COUNTRYMAN  Dispersed, as you commanded.

SCHOOLMASTER  Couple, then, and see what's wanting.
Where's the Bavian?--My friend, carry your tail
without offense or scandal to the ladies; and be
sure you tumble with audacity and manhood, and
when you bark, do it with judgment.

BAVIAN  Yes, sir.

SCHOOLMASTER  Quo usque tandem? Here is a woman
wanting.

FOURTH COUNTRYMAN  We may go whistle; all the fat's i'
th' fire.

SCHOOLMASTER  We have, as learned authors utter,
washed a tile; we have been fatuus and labored
vainly.

SECOND COUNTRYMAN  This is that scornful piece, that
scurvy hilding that gave her promise faithfully she
would be here--Cicely, the sempster's daughter.
The next gloves that I give her shall be dogskin;
nay, an she fail me once--you can tell, Arcas, she
swore by wine and bread she would not break.

SCHOOLMASTER  An eel and woman, a learned poet
says, unless by th' tail and with thy teeth thou hold,
will either fail. In manners, this was false
position.

FIRST COUNTRYMAN  A fire ill take her! Does she flinch
