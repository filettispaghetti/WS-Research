Though I had died. But loving such a lady,
And justifying my love, I must not fly from 't.

PALAMON
Arcite, thou art so brave an enemy
That no man but thy cousin's fit to kill thee.
I am well and lusty. Choose your arms.

ARCITE  Choose you, sir.

PALAMON
Wilt thou exceed in all, or dost thou do it
To make me spare thee?

ARCITE  If you think so, cousin,
You are deceived, for as I am a soldier,
I will not spare you.

PALAMON  That's well said.

ARCITE  You'll find it.

PALAMON
Then, as I am an honest man and love
With all the justice of affection,
I'll pay thee soundly.	[He chooses armor.]
This I'll take.

ARCITE [taking the other]  That's mine, then.
I'll arm you first.

PALAMON  Do.	[Arcite begins arming him.]
Pray thee tell me, cousin,
Where got'st thou this good armor?

ARCITE  'Tis the Duke's,
And to say true, I stole it. Do I pinch you?

PALAMON  No.

ARCITE
Is 't not too heavy?

PALAMON  I have worn a lighter,
But I shall make it serve.

ARCITE  I'll buckle 't close.

PALAMON
By any means.
