
EMILIA
By your own spotless honor--

HIPPOLYTA  By that faith,
That fair hand, and that honest heart you gave me--

EMILIA
By that you would have pity in another;
By your own virtues infinite--

HIPPOLYTA  By valor;
By all the chaste nights I have ever pleased you--

THESEUS
These are strange conjurings.

PIRITHOUS  Nay, then, I'll in too.
[He kneels.]
By all our friendship, sir, by all our dangers;
By all you love most, wars and this sweet lady--

EMILIA
By that you would have trembled to deny
A blushing maid--

HIPPOLYTA  By your own eyes; by strength,
In which you swore I went beyond all women,
Almost all men, and yet I yielded, Theseus--

PIRITHOUS
To crown all this: by your most noble soul,
Which cannot want due mercy, I beg first--

HIPPOLYTA
Next hear my prayers--

EMILIA  Last let me entreat, sir--

PIRITHOUS
For mercy.

HIPPOLYTA  Mercy.

EMILIA  Mercy on these princes.

THESEUS
You make my faith reel. [(To Emilia.)] Say I felt
Compassion to 'em both, how would you place it?
[They rise from their knees.]
