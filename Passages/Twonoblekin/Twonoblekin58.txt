I wish his weary soul that falls may win it.
Fight bravely, cousin. Give me thy noble hand.

ARCITE, [as they shake hands]
Here, Palamon. This hand shall never more
Come near thee with such friendship.

PALAMON  I commend thee.

ARCITE
If I fall, curse me, and say I was a coward,
For none but such dare die in these just trials.
Once more farewell, my cousin.

PALAMON  Farewell, Arcite.
[Fight.]
[Horns within. They stand.]

ARCITE
Lo, cousin, lo, our folly has undone us!

PALAMON  Why?

ARCITE
This is the Duke, a-hunting, as I told you.
If we be found, we are wretched. O, retire,
For honor's sake, and safely, presently
Into your bush again. Sir, we shall find
Too many hours to die in. Gentle cousin,
If you be seen, you perish instantly
For breaking prison, and I, if you reveal me,
For my contempt. Then all the world will scorn us,
And say we had a noble difference,
But base disposers of it.

PALAMON  No, no, cousin,
I will no more be hidden, nor put off
This great adventure to a second trial.
I know your cunning, and I know your cause.
He that faints now, shame take him! Put thyself
Upon thy present guard--

ARCITE  You are not mad?

PALAMON
Or I will make th' advantage of this hour
Mine own, and what to come shall threaten me
I fear less than my fortune. Know, weak cousin,
I love Emilia, and in that I'll bury
Thee and all crosses else.
