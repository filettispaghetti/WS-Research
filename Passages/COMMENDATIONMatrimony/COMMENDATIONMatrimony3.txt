matrimony were of god, not of na¦ture. And of this the bastarde chil∣dren be called naturall: but those that come of matrimony, be onely laufull. And therfore he is not ad∣mitted to holy orders, whose mo∣ther is not knytte to his father by laufull copulation in this mooste worthy sacrament of matrimony, for a bond of perpetual felowship. For a bastarde shall not enter into * the churche of god. Which bastard also is straytely prohybited, bothe by humayne lawes and constituti∣ons of wyse men, to be the heyre of temporal landes and goodes. For they haue no laufull heyre, whiche by neglectynge and despising ma∣trimony, at the wanton and enty∣synge luste of the fleshe, vnlauful∣ly take theyr congresse. And it is the common sentence and iudge∣ment
Page  [unnumbered]
of lawiers, that he hathe an vncertayne father, and a naughty mother, whiche is not borne in ma¦trimony. For he is base borne, and is the sonne of the people, yea ra∣ther the sonne of no man, which is the chylde of a woman not lauful∣ly maryed. But he is the true heir, and trewe sonne, whose mother, without the infamy of sinne, with∣out the blame of kynsfolke, with∣out the offence of god, to a certayn and well knowen father, with the dignite of matrimonye, and with fruite certayn is maried, and with out sclander abydeth by hym con∣tynually. Therfore onely matry∣mony maketh chyldren to be cer∣tayne, & giueth vndoubtful heires it maketh honest the couplynge of nature, and for sinne it giueth me∣ryte, it increaseth the stocke and

out the consent of eyther of theym that is coupled, the other without synne, maye not intende to prayer, if therby it myght chance the other to be defrauded, or lacke the car∣nall duetie. For (as the Apostle sayth) the woman hath not power * of her body, but the man: and like wyse the man hath not power of his body, but the womanne. So great is the knotte of this bonde, that though for incontinency alon¦ly it be taken, yet if one of the cou∣ples afterward wold continually lyue continently, in no wyse it can be done, but with the others con∣sent, yea and though bothe do con¦sent, yet it can in no wyse be taken, that the matrimonye is dissolued. So he that for cause of bryngyng forth of chyldren maryeth, can not without synne put awaye his ba∣ren
Page  [unnumbered]
wyfe, and mary an other, wher by he might haue chyldren. Which thyng also as wytnessen Ualerius Maximus, Plutarch, and Dio∣nisius Halicarnasseus, was obser¦ued and kept amōg the Romains after the Citie was buylded, fyue hundreth and twenty yeres, to the tyme of Spurius Carbilius, whi∣che fyrste of all other preferrynge the desyre to haue chyldren, aboue his fidelitie in wedlocke, not with out his greate blame, forsoke his wyfe for barennesse. But nowe I wyll retourne.

¶ God the creator of all thynges, wolde this moste holy bonde to be so faste and indyssoluble, that for what cause so euer it was ones be∣gonne, by no power or strength at any tyme it shoulde be dyssolued. He wolde it to be so generall, and
Page  [unnumbered]
throughout al the worlde, so pryn∣ted in all mennes myndes, that no man shulde auoyde this moste ho∣lyest mistery, without mooste gre∣uous offence, excepte he wolde vt∣terly forsake all humanytie. For he the fyrste auctor of wedlocke, & god before all matrymony (when he wold take on hym the nature of man) wolde his mother fyrste to mary. And though without mans sede he wold be borne of a virgin, yet he wold not be borne of her out of wedlocke, but of his mother ma¦ried, thoughe not defoyled with man. For he wolde not his mother to be vnmaryed, that by his mo∣thers example, he myghte exhorte vs to the very same.

¶ Therfore what so euer they be that regarde not this mooste aun∣cient and moste holy ordinaunce,
Page  [unnumbered]
as dispisers of goddes and mans lawes, shall be iuged to perpetual fyre, euen lyke the drye and baren trees. And therfore in the old law, they that in theyr rype age, did not mary a wyfe, were put forth of the temples, theyr offerynges were re∣iected, they were counted not wor∣thy to receyue herytages and be∣questes, vnworthy of goddes and mannes helpe, whiche despysynge goddes and mannes lawes, refu∣sed to take the helpe ordeyned for them of god, and stablyshed by the lawes of man. Neuerthelesse two kyndes of menne maye be excepte from contracting matrimony, whi¦che for weakenes of nature, be vt∣terly not apt for it, as they that be colde of nature, bewyched and en∣chaunted, madde personnes, chil∣dren, feble persons, and suche as
Page  [unnumbered]
be gelded, and those whiche being moued with the spirit of god haue chosen perpetuall chastytie. For this sort, religion dischargeth frō the bonde of matrimony: and the other sorte, by naturall impedy∣ment, is excused. But who so euer be not of one of those two kyndes, let them well knowe, that they are so bounden to contracte matrimo∣ny, that if they leaue it, or not re∣garde it (except they be greatly re∣pentant) they are vnworthy of the kyngedome of god. yet for al that, no manne shulde be compelled by force, to contracte matrimony. For in as moche as this bond is made by onely consent of loue, it oughte specially to be free, for loue it selfe, is at no mannes commandement. For the gyftes of ryche menne bye not loue, no dignitie, nor yet nobi∣litie
Page  [unnumbered]
counteruayleth loue, no thret∣nynges or vyolence of great men of power, can compell loue, which god him selfe doth not constraine, but from the begynnynge created it free. And there is no loue so ve∣hement, and so stedfast as betwene the husband and the wyfe. There is nothynge of greatter force, then the tender loue of the wife, the whi¦che no disloyaltie corrupteth, noo misfortune causeth to slyde, noo strang acquaintāce withdraweth, no age, no processe of tyme consu∣meth. And therfore by the coman∣dement * of god, the loue of the wife shoulde be preferred before father and mother, childrē, brothers and syhers, kynsfolke, alyaunce, and all other thynges. Wherfore they moste greuously offende, what so euer they be, parentes, nere kyns∣folke,
Page  [unnumbered]
tutours, and gardians, whi∣che (hauinge no respecte to the cō∣tinuall beneuolence of the lyfe, to the procreation of chyldren, nor to chastitie, but throughe couetous∣nesse and ambition that they haue to worldly dignitie nobilytie, pa∣wer, ryches, and suche lyke) be∣yonde all due obedience to paren∣tes by goddes commmandemente (by a certain tiranny) restrain and make bonde (whiche to this sacra∣ment oughte to be gyuen) the free consent of their sonnes and dough ters, and compel them to be mari∣ed to suche as they hate, withoute any consideration of age, loue, cō∣dition, maners, and specyally of goddes commaundemente. And hereof at lengeth do ryse betwene man and wyfe, fornication, adul∣tery, debate, raylinge wordes, con¦tinuall
Page  [unnumbered]
anger, perpetual strife dis∣corde, hatred, diuorces, and other infinite mischiefes. And also other whyle poysonynge, slaugher, and violent murther ensueth: that it maye be sene, that it was not god but the dyuell, that coupled suche * personnes to gether.

¶ Furthermore in many places, certayne worldly prynces and lor∣des of christēdome, the enemyes of god, blasphemers of Jesu Christ, defilers of holy thynges, presump¦tuousely takynge vpon them that perteyneth to god, at theyr volun∣tary wyl, yea and somtime at their expresse commaundement, compel theyr subiectes to mary. purcha∣synge moreouer to theyr cofers the dymes of dowryes, not without abominable sacrilege, and so for∣bearing the aduouterers, they pu∣nyshe
Page  [unnumbered]
them that mary, which wic∣ked rulers at the laste the ryghtu∣ouse * iudge wyll destroye.

¶ There is also an other no lesse damnable custome, whiche hath taken place among many nations to speake commonly euyll of them that mary the second time. yea and moreouer they cōdemne them that mary agayne in a certayne somme of money, and the same they ley vp for a knotte of good company, to make mery with, and they make Joseph the husbande of the moste blessed vyrgin Mary, the patrone of this so wicked sclander against goddes misterye. But the dyuell hath found these felowshyps and brotherhed, and the anger of god, hath delyuered them into a repro∣ued sence, that they reioysynge at * adultery, horedome, and fornica∣tions,
Page  [unnumbered]
shulde rayle vppon seconde mariages, as who sayth the grace of god is voyde in such mariages, mockinge that sacrament, to whi∣che all honour, reuerence, and ly∣bertie, is gyuen. But this damna∣ble fasciō must be taken away and plucked cleane out of the dommy∣ons of Fraunce: for trewely the ru¦lers therof can not in any poynte do more seruice to god, & profit the chrysten common welthe, then to do this, that is to saye, that good thynges maye be taught, and euel thynges maye be banysshed, not onely that perteine to the common societie of men, but also to goddes religion.

¶ Thou therfore, who soo euer thou arte, that wyll take a wyfe, let loue be the cause, not substance of goodes, chose a wyfe, not a gar
Page  [unnumbered]
ment, let thy wyfe be maryed vnto the, not her dowrye. With this mynde almighty god beinge ther∣to called (whiche alone gyueth a trewe wyfe) and the consent of the parentes also required, and dewe obedieuce shewed vnto them, al co uetousnesse, desyre of honour, en∣uy, and feare, sette a parte, with a temperate deliberation in thy selfe with consent, free and feruent, but reasonable and chast loue, so take thy wyfe, commytted and gyuen to the for euer by the hand of god, for thy continuall felowshyp, not to seruice and bondage. Whome thou oughteste to rule with thy wisedome, with all fauour and re∣uerence. And let not her be subiect vnto the, but let her be with the in all trust and counsayle, & let her be in thy house, not as a drudge, but
Page  [unnumbered]
as maistresse of the house, in thy householde not as a mayden, but a mother, & a brynger vp of those children that thou shalt begette of her, whiche shall be lordes of thy goodes, and represent thy name, to such as shal come after the. And so thou canste not chose but haue a good wyfe, and good chyldren, for an euyll wyfe neuer happeneth but to an euyl husband. For with∣out a wyfe, the name can not con∣tinue, nor the progeny endure, nor the stock increace, nor a family be, nother a father of housholde na∣med, nor a house called, nor a com∣mon welthe stand, nor any impire endure. This thynge the buylder of the Romayne impire ryght well dyd knowe, whiche (when he lac∣ked wiues for his subiectes) made a sharpe and fierse battayle with
Page  [unnumbered]
the Sabinis, that denyed theyr doughters. For he knew very wel, that his impire coulde not conty∣nue, if wyues shuld be awaye. For seing that a citie standeth of hou∣ses, and the common welth of pry∣uate thynges, and of rulynge of a housholde, and family, the disey∣plyne to gouerne a common welth is ordeyned: howe shall he rule a citie, that hath not lerned to rule a house? howe shall he gouerne a common welthe, that neuer knewe his priuate and familiar busines? Nereof Socrates testified, that he lerned morall philosophy more of wyues, then naturall philosophy, of Anaxagoras and Archelaus. For trewely matrimony gyueth a gret erercise to moral philosophy. For it hath a certayne householde common welth annexed, in ruling
Page  [unnumbered]
the whiche a man maye sone lerne and haue experyence of wisedome, temperaunce, loue to god and his kynne, and all other vertues, by which in louyng his wyfe, in brin∣gynge vp his children, in gouer∣nynge his famyly, in sauynge his goodes, in ruling his littel house, in procreatynge and enlargynge his stocke, he may leade a life most happy. Furthermore to see before a mannes eyes, his well beloued wife, and by chyldren and succes∣sion, to haue his family and name extended, is great gladnes and fe∣licitie, it is the swete consolation of trauayle. He that wanteth a wyfe, hath noo house, bycause he hath not setled a house, yea and if he haue, he taryeth in it as a stran∣ger in his mne. He that hath not a wyfe, though he be neuer so riche,
Page  [unnumbered]
hath almoste nothyng that is his, bycause he hath nothing safe from deceytes, nor he hath not to whom he myghte leaue, nor to whom he myghte truste. He that hath not a wyse, lacketh a famylye, lacketh his nye kynred, and without hope of succession is alwayes left alone and forsaken. His seruantes steale from hym, his felowes bribe from hym, his neighbours despise him, his frendes regarde hym not, his nye kinred begile him, his bastard chyldren if he haue any, be shame and rebuke to hym, and wytnesse of his iniquitie, nor he can leaue vnto thē his ryches, nor the name of his famyly, but as he taryeth in lyfe without maryage, soo beinge dead, his perisheth without name, nor in this lif he deserueth to haue any beneuolence orloue, which is
Page  [unnumbered]
greatest comforte to man. But as a forsaker of mans nature, worthy of all calamitie, is moste vnfortu∣nate counted of all men, and most worthy to be forsaken. And hereof Lycurgus made a lawe, that who at conuenient tyme did not regard to mary, they in the sommer tyme shoulde be kepte backe from open plaies and sportes, frō al pastime, and mery syghtes: and in the win∣ter, shuld be led bare round about the market place, and vexed with mockes and scornes, abhored and cried out apon of all men, so that they shulde confesse that they dyd ryghtuousely suffer, bycause they despised relygyon, obeyed not the lawes, offended agaynste nature, and as moch as was in them, cau∣sed that neyther common welthe, impire, nor religion coulde stande,
Page  [unnumbered]
bycause they had not endeuoured them selues, to begette those, by whom these thinges shuld be mein¦teined and vpholden. Plato in his lawes ordeyned, he that maryed not a wyfe shulde be put backe frō al common office and honour, and shoulde be ouerate with common charges more greuous then other citizens were. And Augustus Ce∣sar made a lawe, that yonge men shulde mary wyues, and increase the people of Rome. whiche lawe many other afterward confirmed, And more ouer granted to be free from common offyce a yere. and li∣mitted out of the comon treasure a rewarde to hym that maryed a wyfe a newe. Aduoutries euerye where in the old time always were greuously punysshed with mooste sharpe lawes, bycause that matri∣mony
Page  [unnumbered]
being ones violate, there is not onely wrong done to man, but to god hym self. And hereof in the * olde lawe, who so euer with brea∣kyng matrimony, had committed aduoutry, was aduidged to be sto¦ned to deathe. But he that toke a∣way other mennes goodes, and so commytted theft, was punished in foure double and fyue double as moche. For this man vnlaufullye toke awaye mennes goodes, and worldly thynges, the other besides the offence and hurt of his neygh∣bour yea being miuriouse to god, doth dishonest the godly thinges. The Romayne lawes condemne to deathe aduoutrers, and permit also vnto the husband without a∣ny opē iugement and without pu∣nishment to sle thaduoutrer takē, which lyberty is not gyuen to hym
