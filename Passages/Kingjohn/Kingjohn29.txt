Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
QUEEN ELINOR
Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand.
CONSTANCE
Look to that, devil; lest that France repent,
And by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul.
AUSTRIA
King Philip, listen to the cardinal.
BASTARD
And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.
AUSTRIA
Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs, Because--
BASTARD
Your breeches best may carry them.
KING JOHN
Philip, what say'st thou to the cardinal?
CONSTANCE
What should he say, but as the cardinal?
LEWIS
Bethink you, father; for the difference
Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,
Or the light loss of England for a friend:
Forego the easier.
BLANCH
That's the curse of Rome.
CONSTANCE
O Lewis, stand fast! the devil tempts thee here
In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.
BLANCH
The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,
But from her need.
CONSTANCE
O, if thou grant my need,
Which only lives but by the death of faith,
That need must needs infer this principle,
That faith would live again by death of need.
O then, tread down my need, and faith mounts up;
Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!
KING JOHN
The king is moved, and answers not to this.
CONSTANCE
O, be removed from him, and answer well!
AUSTRIA
Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
BASTARD
Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.
KING PHILIP
I am perplex'd, and know not what to say.
CARDINAL PANDULPH
What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,
