Sits mocking in our plumes. O merchante fortune!
Do not run away.
A short alarum

Constable
Why, all our ranks are broke.
DAUPHIN
O perdurable shame! let's stab ourselves.
Be these the wretches that we play'd at dice for?
ORLEANS

Like a base pander, hold the chamber-door
Whilst by a slave, no gentler than my dog,
His fairest daughter is contaminated.

To smother up the English in our throngs,
If any order might be thought upon.
BOURBON
The devil take order now! I'll to the throng:
Let life be short; else shame will be too long.
Exeunt

Alarums. Enter KING HENRY and forces, EXETER, and others
KING HENRY V
Well have we done, thrice valiant countrymen:
But all's not done; yet keep the French the field.
EXETER
The Duke of York commends him to your majesty.
KING HENRY V
Lives he, good uncle? thrice within this hour
I saw him down; thrice up again and fighting;
From helmet to the spur all blood he was.
EXETER
In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie,
Larding the plain; and by his bloody side,
Yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds,
The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.
Suffolk first died: and York, all haggled over,
Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteep'd,
