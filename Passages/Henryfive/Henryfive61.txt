Good argument, I hope, we will not fly--
And time hath worn us into slovenry:
But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim;
And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night
They'll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck
The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads
And turn them out of service. If they do this,--
As, if God please, they shall,--my ransom then
Will soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labour;
Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald:
They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;
Which if they have as I will leave 'em them,
Shall yield them little, tell the constable.
MONTJOY
I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well:
Thou never shalt hear herald any more.
Exit

KING HENRY V
I fear thou'lt once more come again for ransom.
Enter YORK

YORK
My lord, most humbly on my knee I beg
The leading of the vaward.
KING HENRY V
Take it, brave York. Now, soldiers, march away:
And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day!
Exeunt

SCENE IV. The field of battle.

Alarum. Excursions. Enter PISTOL, French Soldier, and Boy
PISTOL
Yield, cur!
French Soldier
Je pense que vous etes gentilhomme de bonne qualite.
PISTOL
Qualtitie calmie custure me! Art thou a gentleman?
what is thy name? discuss.
French Soldier
O Seigneur Dieu!
PISTOL
O, Signieur Dew should be a gentleman:
Perpend my words, O Signieur Dew, and mark;
O Signieur Dew, thou diest on point of fox,
Except, O signieur, thou do give to me
Egregious ransom.
French Soldier
O, prenez misericorde! ayez pitie de moi!
