PISTOL
Qui va la?
KING HENRY V
A friend.
PISTOL
Discuss unto me; art thou officer?
Or art thou base, common and popular?
KING HENRY V
I am a gentleman of a company.
PISTOL
Trail'st thou the puissant pike?
KING HENRY V
Even so. What are you?
PISTOL
As good a gentleman as the emperor.
KING HENRY V
Then you are a better than the king.
PISTOL
The king's a bawcock, and a heart of gold,
A lad of life, an imp of fame;
Of parents good, of fist most valiant.
I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heart-string
I love the lovely bully. What is thy name?
KING HENRY V
Harry le Roy.
PISTOL
Le Roy! a Cornish name: art thou of Cornish crew?
KING HENRY V
No, I am a Welshman.
PISTOL
Know'st thou Fluellen?
KING HENRY V
Yes.
PISTOL
Tell him, I'll knock his leek about his pate
Upon Saint Davy's day.
KING HENRY V
Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day,
lest he knock that about yours.
PISTOL
Art thou his friend?
KING HENRY V
And his kinsman too.
PISTOL
The figo for thee, then!
KING HENRY V
I thank you: God be with you!
PISTOL
