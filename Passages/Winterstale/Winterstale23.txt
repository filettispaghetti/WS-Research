Gaoler
For a worthy lady
And one whom much I honour.
PAULINA
Pray you then,
Conduct me to the queen.
Gaoler
I may not, madam:
To the contrary I have express commandment.
PAULINA
Here's ado,
To lock up honesty and honour from
The access of gentle visitors!
Is't lawful, pray you,
To see her women? any of them? Emilia?
Gaoler
So please you, madam,
To put apart these your attendants, I
Shall bring Emilia forth.
PAULINA
I pray now, call her.
Withdraw yourselves.
Exeunt Gentleman and Attendants

Gaoler
And, madam,
I must be present at your conference.
PAULINA
Well, be't so, prithee.
Exit Gaoler

Here's such ado to make no stain a stain
As passes colouring.
Re-enter Gaoler, with EMILIA

Dear gentlewoman,
How fares our gracious lady?
EMILIA
As well as one so great and so forlorn
May hold together: on her frights and griefs,
Which never tender lady hath born greater,
She is something before her time deliver'd.
PAULINA
A boy?
EMILIA
A daughter, and a goodly babe,
Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,
I am innocent as you.'
PAULINA
