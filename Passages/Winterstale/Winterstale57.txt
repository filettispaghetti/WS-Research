And you shall pay well for 'em.
Follows singing

Will you buy any tape,
Or lace for your cape,
My dainty duck, my dear-a?
Any silk, any thread,
Any toys for your head,
Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?
Come to the pedlar;
Money's a medler.
That doth utter all men's ware-a.

Re-enter Servant

Servant
Master, there is three carters, three shepherds,
three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made
themselves all men of hair, they call themselves
Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches
say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are
not in't; but they themselves are o' the mind, if it
be not too rough for some that know little but
bowling, it will please plentifully.
Shepherd
Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much
homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.
POLIXENES
You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see
these four threes of herdsmen.
Servant
One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath
danced before the king; and not the worst of the
three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.
Shepherd
Leave your prating: since these good men are
pleased, let them come in; but quickly now.
Servant
Why, they stay at door, sir.
Exit

Here a dance of twelve Satyrs

POLIXENES
O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.
To CAMILLO

Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.
He's simple and tells much.
