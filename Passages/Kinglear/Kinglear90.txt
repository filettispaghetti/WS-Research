REGAN
Why is this reason'd?
GONERIL
Combine together 'gainst the enemy;
For these domestic and particular broils
Are not the question here.
ALBANY
Let's then determine
With the ancient of war on our proceedings.
EDMUND
I shall attend you presently at your tent.
REGAN
Sister, you'll go with us?
GONERIL
No.
REGAN
'Tis most convenient; pray you, go with us.
GONERIL
[Aside] O, ho, I know the riddle.--I will go.
As they are going out, enter EDGAR disguised

EDGAR
If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,
Hear me one word.
ALBANY
I'll overtake you. Speak.
Exeunt all but ALBANY and EDGAR

EDGAR
Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
If you have victory, let the trumpet sound
For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,
I can produce a champion that will prove
What is avouched there. If you miscarry,
Your business of the world hath so an end,
And machination ceases. Fortune love you.
ALBANY
Stay till I have read the letter.
EDGAR
I was forbid it.
When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,
And I'll appear again.
ALBANY
Why, fare thee well: I will o'erlook thy paper.
Exit EDGAR

Re-enter EDMUND

EDMUND
The enemy's in view; draw up your powers.
