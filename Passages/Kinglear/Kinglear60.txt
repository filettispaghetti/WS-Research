Come hissing in upon 'em,--
EDGAR
The foul fiend bites my back.
Fool
He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a
horse's health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath.
KING LEAR
It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.
To EDGAR

Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer;
To the Fool

Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you she foxes!
EDGAR
Look, where he stands and glares!
Wantest thou eyes at trial, madam?
Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me,--
Fool
Her boat hath a leak,
And she must not speak
Why she dares not come over to thee.
EDGAR
The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a
nightingale. Hopdance cries in Tom's belly for two
white herring. Croak not, black angel; I have no
food for thee.
KENT
How do you, sir? Stand you not so amazed:
Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?
KING LEAR
I'll see their trial first. Bring in the evidence.
To EDGAR

Thou robed man of justice, take thy place;
To the Fool

And thou, his yoke-fellow of equity,
Bench by his side:
To KENT

you are o' the commission,
Sit you too.
EDGAR
Let us deal justly.
Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?
Thy sheep be in the corn;
And for one blast of thy minikin mouth,
Thy sheep shall take no harm.
Pur! the cat is gray.
