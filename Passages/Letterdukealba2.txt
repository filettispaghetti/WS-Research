To the Reader.

HAuing of late diuers & sundrie times bene vrged to write, declare, & put in light the iuste occasions, mouing vs to put on armes, & to stand in defence against certain our straūge and foraine enimies: of whose force, vniust, and cruell tyranny, we haue also giuen to vnderstand al Christiā Prin∣ces and Potentates, nations and coūtries. And hauing also sufficiently answered and put to silence such iniurious and slaunde∣rous Bookes, writings, and libels, as our said aduersaries had put in light, whereby they thought & sought to make vs odious vnto al kinds of people: our hope and con∣fidēce was that thei wold haue once abstai∣ned from their slaunderous writings, sée∣ing it so smally serued their purpose: which for a long time they séemed to doe. But at the last, perceyuing yt since their ti∣rānous regimēt began, ye longer, ye more it became lothsome vnto all people: and that there was small hope to obteyne to their
Page  [unnumbered]
former aucthoritie, force, and regiment, by force of armes, do now returne to their ac∣customed prancks, and would faine vnder pretence of pardons, and letters of fauour (through false accusations) bring vs in ha∣tred with all men, and by vntrue persuasi∣ons séeme to purge their owne factes, ther∣by alluring the people vnto them, and so by littel and littell reduce the townes & coun∣tries reuolted from them, to their vile yoke of seruitude.

And to that intent haue they of late put forth a certaine letter vnder the name of ye Duke of Alba, offering therby pardon and forgiuenes vnto the said townes of al their trāsgressions (as they term it) cōditionally, that they shoulde willingly submit them∣selues to their obeysance and subiection. Which letters were by meanes of them of Amsterdam dispersed into diuers townes in Holland.

Notwithstanding, we are assured suffi∣ciently that no person of vnderstanding & discretion, much lesse townes & countries, wilbe moued by these their cautelous and most false and slaunderous Bookes, to re∣turne from the frée and loyall obedience &

••ruice of our most natural Lord and King •he kyng of Spaine, vnder whom ye Prince •f Orange beareth the gouernement, to •he shamefull and accursed seruitude of a •traunge generation: yet to the intent to make the trueth manifest vnto all men, & •o detect the false and subtile practises and •euises of our enimies, we coulde not but aunswere vnto the sayde letter. Desi∣ring al such as regard the common wealth of their countrie, the preseruation of his wife and children, his life and goods, to read this with indifferencie, and not to suffer themselues to be seduced by the false propositions of our sworne enimies, but rather with all their power to aduaunce ye iustnesse of our cause & deliuery of our coū∣trie, from the vnsupportable yoke of this straunge nation.

TRustie and welbeloued, it is well inough knowne that the kyng our soueraign• Lord is one of the myldest and most graci∣ous Princes that may bee found, yet haue the Rebells endeuored themselues with lies and false persuasions, to persuade diuers townes to the contrary, putting a doubt in their heads, to the intent to seduce and al∣lure them from the obedience of his maie∣stie, as they haue done: wheras in dede (as commonly the trueth will not remaine vn∣knowen) it hath appeared what hath bene done with the townes of Gelderland, Fries∣land, Ouerissell and Vtrecht, which were re∣uolted, who of their free accords vncompel∣led haue put themselues vnder the obedi∣ence of his maiestie, who hath not touched any one Burges or inhabitant of the same, but hath suffered him to remayne in his former estat, enioying and possessing their owne goods, as they did before their re∣uolt. But hath vsed rigor onely against such townes as haue offered weapons and stoode at defence: And the like grace as afore∣sayde
Page  [unnumbered]
wee intende to extende towardes all ••ch other Townes in Hollande as in lyke •rder will submit them selues to the obey∣••nce of his Maiestie without attending the •ōming of his armie, which we in the name and behalfe of his Maiestie, do firmely pro∣•ise and assure by these presentes: whereof •e thought good to aduertise you, to the •ntent ye giue knowledge to the Townes whom ye hope wilbe reduced: admonishing them further to haue a regarde to this occa∣•ion offered, not slacking the benefit there∣•f, & to return to the obeisance which they owe to the Kings Ma. their naturall Prince and Lord, whose grace and fauour they with •ll the Burgesses & Inhabitants of the same, •o presenting them selues within xv. dayes after the receipt of your notice and insinu∣ation, shall receyue, without thinking on or calling to remembrance any matters past: whereof ye may firmely assure them on our behalfe, and wee promise you by these our letters by vs subsigned, that such shalbe per∣formed and accomplished without default or contrauention. Shewing them further, how greatly they erre, if they think to with∣stand the Kings power, and what euill suc∣cesse it will haue if they obstinately persiste

and will trye his Maiesties power and force Trustie and welbeloued, the Lord bee wyth you. VVritten in Nymmeghen the x. day of Februarie 1572. after the style of th• Court, Signed F. A.

An answere to the letter late∣ly sent by the Duke of Alba, (written in ma¦ner of a pardon) to those of Amsterdam, and to be by thē conueyed to all the Townes there about.

THE confidence and assu∣red persuasion that wée haue alwayes had and yet haue of the kings naturall disposition, hath besides many other weightie rea∣sons
Page  [unnumbered]
and considerations moued vs, that we can not ascribe or impute this vnreaso∣nable and tyrannous regiment, the open subuersion of all good customes, rightes, v∣sances, priuileges and liberties of ye towns and whole Countrie, vsed by a straunge Nation, now of late, cōtrarie to the Kings promises, letters, and othe, by méere force brought into the same, vpon the Kings Ma∣iestie. For séeing we haue effectually found him a louer of his subiects, a mild hearer of the complaintes and cryes of the poore and suppressed, a tutor of the iust, and a defen∣dour of the liberties and rightes of the coū∣trie. How can wée then beléeue by any meanes, that he of his own frée will, should permit (much lesse commaund) that these his naturall base Countries should thus pi∣tifully be suppressed, and by violence of a straunge Nation, brought to euerlastinge subuersion and ruine? For at the first, not being conquered by the sword, but through friendly alliance and agréement first ioy∣ned with the famous house of Austria, and afterwards with the Kingdomes of Spayne, and so from time to time haue vsed their entire affection and faithfull seruice, aswell
Page  [unnumbered]
towards his Maiestie, as also to his moste noble Auncesters, with singular industrie and diligēce. Namely in the last warres wt France, it hath manifestly appeared, wher∣in they neither spared charges nor paynes: but to the maintenāce of the same, in short space leuied iiij.C. millions of Golde, and likewise in all other matters, declared to∣wards his Maiestie all due obedience. Also his Maiestie hath againe at al times shew∣ed a Fatherly and benigne disposition to∣wards the said Countries. Howe could hée then haue stopped his eares from the cryes and lamentations of his poore and true sub∣iectes? Or how could he shut his eyes and not behold the lasciuious and wilfull dea∣lings of a straunge Nation? or his hart be shut vp from hauing compassion ouer such a miserable destructiō of his Townes and Countrie, so florishing and prospering at that time, as no land in Christēdome more. Where as the States of the whole lande, aswell in generall as particular, yea the chiefest of the Nobilitie and Lordes them∣selues with humble Supplications, Re∣monstrances, Ambassades and many other meanes, haue obediently requested to bée
Page  [unnumbered]
hard indifferētly, and to be released of such a tyrannicall yoke. No certainly, we know and beléeue that our King of nature is the most gratious and mercyfullest Prince that may be found. But séeing we know this, we conclude resolutely, that this is not his doing nor will, which by the Albanish facti∣on hath of late ben done, but they giue the King to vnderstand slaunderous tales by them falsely deuised, kéeping him faste in Spaine, to the intent he should rule accor∣ding to their appetit, abusing his name, seale, and blankes at their pleasure, giuing out commaundements in his name such as best serue for their purpose: which thing is so plaine and notorious, as no man is of so simple vnderstanding and iudgement, which doth not sée, yea féele it. For they perceyuing about vi. yeares past, the No∣bilitie and Gentlemen of the countrie, to take to hart the state of the same, presen∣ting Requests to be dismissed from the In∣quisition and tyrannie of the new Bishops, then could they beginne to say, that to the Kinges naturall good inclination towards his subiects, and their good obedience, great wrong was offered: as who would say, it
Page  [unnumbered]
was not the Kings mind nor pleasure that his owne Landes should bee charged with such a tirannicall seruitude as the Inqui∣sition is, & that he neuer thought it, which thei published vnder the Kings letters and seale, which they sent not onely vnto cer∣taine townes and congregations, but like∣wise to certaine of the chief Lordes and Nobles of the Lande. Then within a short whyle after (thinking the time fit to serue their turne) they published new Letters & Edictes in the Kings name, expressely to the contrarie: wherein his Maiestie willed and streightly commaunded that the new Bishoppes, the Counsell of Trent, and In∣quisition should be planted, vppon payne of his extréeme displeasure. Within a whyle after, they considering a great alteration like to happen, and some commotion to∣wards amongest the people, not findinge them selues sufficiently strong, they once ageyne called in the same and in the kings name made a new agréement, confirming it vnder his Seale. But within a whyle after (béeinge prouided of a power) the Kyngs letters vnder his great seale, was by them broken and violated, and the com∣mons
Page  [unnumbered]
charged with new othes and taxes. Then began the Gallowes, scaffoldes, and poles, to be erected, the swoordes whetted, and the fiers kindled, and then they began to murther, burne, and hang, all the kyngs true subiects without end or measure: yea the most noblest Lordes of the countrie were forced to flée or to be murtherid. Now wel knowing that they kyng hath no plea∣sure in these doings, that his true subiects should thus vniustly and tirannously bée handled, as he himselfe hath often declared, and as we are fully certified, do therfore (not against our kyng, but against certain presumptious straungers, which haue ad∣uaunced themselues to inuade our country without right or reason,) take the sword in hand to defend and deliuer our bodies from their bloudie swoords, our goods from their gryping hands, & our wiues and daughters from their vnchast desires, knowing ther∣by for certaine, that we do our Kyng here∣in both good and faithfull seruice: the truth wherof being vprightly related vnto him, we hope he wil take in good part. Therfore we do not estéeme our selues for rebels, as this writing doth vniustly charge vs, but
Page  [unnumbered]
the Kyngs true and faithfull seruants, and so wil remain to the death, séeking nothing more than to defend his heritage from the execrable tiranny of straungers, so as the same be not compelled to giue themselues to any reuolting or Rebellion. We also denie that which they further alleage. That we with lies and false persuasions seeke to rayse a slaunder vppon the Kyng, to the states and commons of the countrie, therby to allure his subiects from his obedience, & drawe them to vs. Undoubtedly any reaso∣nable person, may easely consider this to be a false accusation, as all the other are wherewith they burthen vs, and that they themselues are culpable of the same: being manifest, that they haue alwayes wrought with open lies and false persuasi∣ons to set these countries at debate with ye Kyng, by false accusations, therby séeking occasion to inuade the land, and so to bring it vnder their subiection. This is easely to be considered out of the request for ix. yeres which in anno 1552. the King himselfe did propone vnto the generall states of the lād within the towne of Valencia: namely that the meanes wherby to maintain ye warres
Page  [unnumbered]
against Fraunce any longer were at an end, and that his maiestie knew not how to leuie any more money. Desiring therfore that they would appoynt some amongest them, which were expert in the state of the countrie, to find some meanes to succour ye matter. Wheruppon an assembly of their Deputies was kept at Bruxels, where after many deliberations it was finally conclu∣ded, & to the King was graunted ye sume of eight hunderd thousand Gilderns a yeare, for the space of nine yeares, whereof forth∣with should be leuied vppon the sale of rēts xxiiij. hunderd thousand Gilderns for the mayntaining and paying of xviij. thousand footemen, and eight thousand horsemen, whereof the one third parte to be straun∣gers, and the rest inhabitants of the coun∣trie, and that for the space of vj. monethes: ouer and besides twentie shippes of warre for seuen monethes. And further according to the particular instructions therof made, to bring ye same to effecte, there were cer∣taine necessarie specified, without which it had bene hard to persuade the common people. Namely, that the states of the land should haue the administration of the mo∣ney
Page  [unnumbered]
in their hands, and pay the Souldiers according to the instructiōs which should be deliuered vnto them on the Kyngs behalfe: and further they to appoynt certaine per∣sons which should haue the mustering of the Souldiours. This deuise did please his maiestie meruaylous well, and hée hartely thancked them for the good assistance and inclination they shewed towardes him. Which afterward (as appeared) was the greatest and notablest seruice which might haue bene done to his maiestie and the coū∣trie, for therby his maiestie in the extre∣mitie of his necessitie was so holpen, yt the Kyng of Fraunce was greatly amazed at it. This was the onely occasion whereby not onely goodly victories against the eni∣mie were obteyned, but likewise that in ye end a peace was concluded to the great ad∣uauntage and honour of his Maiestie and countries. All this notwithstanding, there were not a few amongst the Spaniardes, (Whose example some of other countries followed) who sought by al meanes to per∣suade the Kyng, that this kind of order did greatly extend to the abasement and disho∣nour of his Maiestie, for that the states (as
