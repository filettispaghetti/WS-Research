Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and LADY GREY
KING EDWARD IV
Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field
This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,
His lands then seized on by the conqueror:
Her suit is now to repossess those lands;
Which we in justice cannot well deny,
Because in quarrel of the house of York
The worthy gentleman did lose his life.
GLOUCESTER
Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
It were dishonour to deny it her.
KING EDWARD IV
It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
GLOUCESTER
[Aside to CLARENCE] Yea, is it so?
I see the lady hath a thing to grant,
Before the king will grant her humble suit.
CLARENCE
[Aside to GLOUCESTER] He knows the game: how true
he keeps the wind!
GLOUCESTER
[Aside to CLARENCE] Silence!
KING EDWARD IV
Widow, we will consider of your suit;
And come some other time to know our mind.
LADY GREY
Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:
May it please your highness to resolve me now;
And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me.
GLOUCESTER
[Aside to CLARENCE] Ay, widow? then I'll warrant
you all your lands,
An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.
Fight closer, or, good faith, you'll catch a blow.
CLARENCE
[Aside to GLOUCESTER] I fear her not, unless she
chance to fall.
GLOUCESTER
[Aside to CLARENCE] God forbid that! for he'll
take vantages.
KING EDWARD IV
How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.
CLARENCE
[Aside to GLOUCESTER] I think he means to beg a
child of her.
GLOUCESTER
[Aside to CLARENCE] Nay, whip me then: he'll rather
give her two.
