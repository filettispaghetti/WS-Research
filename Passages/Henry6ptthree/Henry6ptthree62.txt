Enter KING EDWARD IV and a Huntsman with him

Huntsman
This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.
KING EDWARD IV
Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.
Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?
GLOUCESTER
Brother, the time and case requireth haste:
Your horse stands ready at the park-corner.
KING EDWARD IV
But whither shall we then?
HASTINGS
To Lynn, my lord,
And ship from thence to Flanders.
GLOUCESTER
Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.
KING EDWARD IV
Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.
GLOUCESTER
But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk.
KING EDWARD IV
Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?
Huntsman
Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.
GLOUCESTER
Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.
KING EDWARD IV
Bishop, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown;
And pray that I may repossess the crown.
Exeunt

SCENE VI. London. The Tower.

Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, CLARENCE, WARWICK, SOMERSET, HENRY OF RICHMOND, OXFORD, MONTAGUE, and Lieutenant of the Tower
KING HENRY VI
Master lieutenant, now that God and friends
Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,
And turn'd my captive state to liberty,
My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,
At our enlargement what are thy due fees?
Lieutenant
Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;
But if an humble prayer may prevail,
I then crave pardon of your majesty.
KING HENRY VI
For what, lieutenant? for well using me?
Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,
For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;
