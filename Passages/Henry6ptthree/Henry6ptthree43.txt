Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;
No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.
LADY GREY
Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.
GLOUCESTER
[Aside to CLARENCE] The widow likes him not, she
knits her brows.
CLARENCE
[Aside to GLOUCESTER] He is the bluntest wooer in
Christendom.
KING EDWARD IV
[Aside] Her looks do argue her replete with modesty;
Her words do show her wit incomparable;
All her perfections challenge sovereignty:
One way or other, she is for a king;
And she shall be my love, or else my queen.--
Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?
LADY GREY
'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:
I am a subject fit to jest withal,
But far unfit to be a sovereign.
KING EDWARD IV
Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
I speak no more than what my soul intends;
And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.
LADY GREY
And that is more than I will yield unto:
I know I am too mean to be your queen,
And yet too good to be your concubine.
KING EDWARD IV
You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen.
LADY GREY
'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.
KING EDWARD IV
No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;
And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor,
Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing
To be the father unto many sons.
Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.
GLOUCESTER
[Aside to CLARENCE] The ghostly father now hath done
his shrift.
CLARENCE
[Aside to GLOUCESTER] When he was made a shriver,
'twas for shift.
KING EDWARD IV
Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.
GLOUCESTER
The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.
