DOGBERRY
Yea, marry, that's the eftest way. Let the watch
come forth. Masters, I charge you, in the prince's
name, accuse these men.
First Watchman
This man said, sir, that Don John, the prince's
brother, was a villain.
DOGBERRY
Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat
perjury, to call a prince's brother villain.
BORACHIO
Master constable,--
DOGBERRY
Pray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look,
I promise thee.
Sexton
What heard you him say else?
Second Watchman
Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats of
Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.
DOGBERRY
Flat burglary as ever was committed.
VERGES
Yea, by mass, that it is.
Sexton
What else, fellow?
First Watchman
And that Count Claudio did mean, upon his words, to
disgrace Hero before the whole assembly. and not marry her.
DOGBERRY
O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting
redemption for this.
Sexton
What else?
Watchman
This is all.
Sexton
And this is more, masters, than you can deny.
Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away;
Hero was in this manner accused, in this very manner
refused, and upon the grief of this suddenly died.
Master constable, let these men be bound, and
brought to Leonato's: I will go before and show
him their examination.

DOGBERRY
Come, let them be opinioned.
VERGES
Let them be in the hands--
