Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into
a lute-string and now governed by stops.
DON PEDRO
Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him: conclude,
conclude he is in love.
CLAUDIO
Nay, but I know who loves him.
DON PEDRO
That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.
CLAUDIO
Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of
all, dies for him.
DON PEDRO
She shall be buried with her face upwards.
BENEDICK
Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old
signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight
or nine wise words to speak to you, which these
hobby-horses must not hear.
Exeunt BENEDICK and LEONATO

DON PEDRO
For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.
CLAUDIO
'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this
played their parts with Beatrice; and then the two
bears will not bite one another when they meet.
Enter DON JOHN

DON JOHN
My lord and brother, God save you!
DON PEDRO
Good den, brother.
DON JOHN
If your leisure served, I would speak with you.
DON PEDRO
In private?
DON JOHN
If it please you: yet Count Claudio may hear; for
what I would speak of concerns him.
DON PEDRO
What's the matter?
DON JOHN
[To CLAUDIO] Means your lordship to be married
to-morrow?
DON PEDRO
You know he does.
DON JOHN
I know not that, when he knows what I know.
CLAUDIO
