Withdraws

Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO

DON PEDRO
Come, shall we hear this music?
CLAUDIO
Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,
As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!
DON PEDRO
See you where Benedick hath hid himself?
CLAUDIO
O, very well, my lord: the music ended,
We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.
Enter BALTHASAR with Music

DON PEDRO
Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.
BALTHASAR
O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice
To slander music any more than once.
DON PEDRO
It is the witness still of excellency
To put a strange face on his own perfection.
I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.
BALTHASAR
Because you talk of wooing, I will sing;
Since many a wooer doth commence his suit
To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,
Yet will he swear he loves.
DON PEDRO
Now, pray thee, come;
Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument,
Do it in notes.
BALTHASAR
Note this before my notes;
There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.
DON PEDRO
Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks;
Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing.
Air

BENEDICK
Now, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it
not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out
of men's bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when
all's done.
