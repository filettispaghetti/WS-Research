Enter DOGBERRY, VERGES, and Sexton, in gowns; and the Watch, with CONRADE and BORACHIO
DOGBERRY
Is our whole dissembly appeared?
VERGES
O, a stool and a cushion for the sexton.
Sexton
Which be the malefactors?
DOGBERRY
Marry, that am I and my partner.
VERGES
Nay, that's certain; we have the exhibition to examine.
Sexton
But which are the offenders that are to be
examined? let them come before master constable.
DOGBERRY
Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your
name, friend?
BORACHIO
Borachio.
DOGBERRY
Pray, write down, Borachio. Yours, sirrah?
CONRADE
I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.
DOGBERRY
Write down, master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do
you serve God?
CONRADE BORACHIO
Yea, sir, we hope.
DOGBERRY
Write down, that they hope they serve God: and
write God first; for God defend but God should go
before such villains! Masters, it is proved already
that you are little better than false knaves; and it
will go near to be thought so shortly. How answer
you for yourselves?
CONRADE
Marry, sir, we say we are none.
DOGBERRY
A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you: but I
will go about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a
word in your ear: sir, I say to you, it is thought
you are false knaves.
BORACHIO
Sir, I say to you we are none.
DOGBERRY
Well, stand aside. 'Fore God, they are both in a
tale. Have you writ down, that they are none?
Sexton
Master constable, you go not the way to examine:
you must call forth the watch that are their accusers.
