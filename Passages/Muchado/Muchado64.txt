We had like to have had our two noses snapped off
with two old men without teeth.
DON PEDRO
Leonato and his brother. What thinkest thou? Had
we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.
BENEDICK
In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came
to seek you both.
CLAUDIO
We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are
high-proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten
away. Wilt thou use thy wit?
BENEDICK
It is in my scabbard: shall I draw it?
DON PEDRO
Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?
CLAUDIO
Never any did so, though very many have been beside
their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the
minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.
DON PEDRO
As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou
sick, or angry?
CLAUDIO
What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat,
thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.
BENEDICK
Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you
charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.
CLAUDIO
Nay, then, give him another staff: this last was
broke cross.
DON PEDRO
By this light, he changes more and more: I think
he be angry indeed.
CLAUDIO
If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.
BENEDICK
Shall I speak a word in your ear?
CLAUDIO
God bless me from a challenge!
BENEDICK
[Aside to CLAUDIO] You are a villain; I jest not:
I will make it good how you dare, with what you
dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will
protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet
lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me
hear from you.
CLAUDIO
Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.
