	Daisies smell-less, yet most quaint,
	   And sweet thyme true;
	Primrose, firstborn child of Ver,
	Merry springtime's harbinger,
	   With her bells dim;
	Oxlips in their cradles growing,
	Marigolds on deathbeds blowing,
	   Lark's-heels trim;
	All dear Nature's children sweet
	Lie 'fore bride and bridegroom's feet,
[Strew flowers.]
	   Blessing their sense.
	Not an angel of the air,
	Bird melodious or bird fair,
	   Is absent hence.
	The crow, the sland'rous cuckoo, nor
	The boding raven, nor chough hoar,
	   Nor chatt'ring pie,
	May on our bridehouse perch or sing,
	Or with them any discord bring,
	   But from it fly.

[Enter three Queens in black, with veils stained, with
imperial crowns. The first Queen falls down at the foot
of Theseus; the second falls down at the foot of
Hippolyta; the third before Emilia.]


FIRST QUEEN, [to Theseus]
For pity's sake and true gentility's,
Hear and respect me.

SECOND QUEEN, [to Hippolyta]  For your mother's sake,
And as you wish your womb may thrive with fair
ones,
Hear and respect me.

THIRD QUEEN, [to Emilia]
Now for the love of him whom Jove hath marked
The honor of your bed, and for the sake
Of clear virginity, be advocate
For us and our distresses. This good deed
Shall raze you out o' th' book of trespasses
All you are set down there.

THESEUS, [to First Queen]
Sad lady, rise.

HIPPOLYTA, [to Second Queen]  Stand up.
