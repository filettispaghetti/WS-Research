I greet your honours from Andronicus.
Aside

And pray the Roman gods confound you both!
DEMETRIUS
Gramercy, lovely Lucius: what's the news?
Young LUCIUS
[Aside] That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,
For villains mark'd with rape.--May it please you,
My grandsire, well advised, hath sent by me
The goodliest weapons of his armoury
To gratify your honourable youth,
The hope of Rome; for so he bade me say;
And so I do, and with his gifts present
Your lordships, that, whenever you have need,
You may be armed and appointed well:
And so I leave you both:
Aside

like bloody villains.
Exeunt Young LUCIUS, and Attendant

DEMETRIUS
What's here? A scroll; and written round about?
Let's see;
Reads

'Integer vitae, scelerisque purus,
Non eget Mauri jaculis, nec arcu.'
CHIRON
O, 'tis a verse in Horace; I know it well:
I read it in the grammar long ago.
AARON
Ay, just; a verse in Horace; right, you have it.
Aside

Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!
Here's no sound jest! the old man hath found their guilt;
And sends them weapons wrapped about with lines,
That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.
But were our witty empress well afoot,
She would applaud Andronicus' conceit:
But let her rest in her unrest awhile.
And now, young lords, was't not a happy star
Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so,
Captives, to be advanced to this height?
It did me good, before the palace gate
To brave the tribune in his brother's hearing.
DEMETRIUS
But me more good, to see so great a lord
