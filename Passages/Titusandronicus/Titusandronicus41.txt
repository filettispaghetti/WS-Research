And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,
I will most willingly attend your ladyship.
MARCUS ANDRONICUS
Lucius, I will.
LAVINIA turns over with her stumps the books which LUCIUS has let fall

TITUS ANDRONICUS
How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?
Some book there is that she desires to see.
Which is it, girl, of these? Open them, boy.
But thou art deeper read, and better skill'd
Come, and take choice of all my library,
And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens
Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?
MARCUS ANDRONICUS
I think she means that there was more than one
Confederate in the fact: ay, more there was;
Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.
TITUS ANDRONICUS
Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?
Young LUCIUS
Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;
My mother gave it me.
MARCUS ANDRONICUS
For love of her that's gone,
Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.
TITUS ANDRONICUS
Soft! see how busily she turns the leaves!
Helping her

What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?
This is the tragic tale of Philomel,
And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape:
And rape, I fear, was root of thine annoy.
MARCUS ANDRONICUS
See, brother, see; note how she quotes the leaves.
TITUS ANDRONICUS
Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,
Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods? See, see!
Ay, such a place there is, where we did hunt--
O, had we never, never hunted there!--
Pattern'd by that the poet here describes,
By nature made for murders and for rapes.
MARCUS ANDRONICUS
O, why should nature build so foul a den,
Unless the gods delight in tragedies?
TITUS ANDRONICUS
Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none
