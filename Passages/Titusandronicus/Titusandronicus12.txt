To pardon Mutius and to bury him.
TITUS ANDRONICUS
Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest,
And, with these boys, mine honour thou hast wounded:
My foes I do repute you every one;
So, trouble me no more, but get you gone.
MARTIUS
He is not with himself; let us withdraw.
QUINTUS
Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.
MARCUS and the Sons of TITUS kneel

MARCUS ANDRONICUS
Brother, for in that name doth nature plead,--
QUINTUS
Father, and in that name doth nature speak,--
TITUS ANDRONICUS
Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.
MARCUS ANDRONICUS
Renowned Titus, more than half my soul,--
LUCIUS
Dear father, soul and substance of us all,--
MARCUS ANDRONICUS
Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter
His noble nephew here in virtue's nest,
That died in honour and Lavinia's cause.
Thou art a Roman; be not barbarous:
The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax
That slew himself; and wise Laertes' son
Did graciously plead for his funerals:
Let not young Mutius, then, that was thy joy
Be barr'd his entrance here.
TITUS ANDRONICUS
Rise, Marcus, rise.
The dismall'st day is this that e'er I saw,
To be dishonour'd by my sons in Rome!
Well, bury him, and bury me the next.
MUTIUS is put into the tomb

LUCIUS
There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends,
Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.
All
[Kneeling] No man shed tears for noble Mutius;
He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.
MARCUS ANDRONICUS
My lord, to step out of these dreary dumps,
How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths
Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome?
TITUS ANDRONICUS
