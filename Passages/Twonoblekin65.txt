Come, shake hands again, then,
And take heed, as you are gentlemen, this quarrel
Sleep till the hour prefixed, and hold your course.

PALAMON
We dare not fail thee, Theseus.
[They shake hands again.]

THESEUS  Come, I'll give you
Now usage like to princes and to friends.
When you return, who wins I'll settle here;
Who loses, yet I'll weep upon his bier.
[They exit.]

Scene 1
=======
[Enter Jailer and his Friend.]


JAILER
Heard you no more? Was nothing said of me
Concerning the escape of Palamon?
Good sir, remember!

FIRST FRIEND  Nothing that I heard,
For I came home before the business
Was fully ended. Yet I might perceive,
Ere I departed, a great likelihood
Of both their pardons; for Hippolyta
And fair-eyed Emily, upon their knees,
Begged with such handsome pity that the Duke,
Methought, stood staggering whether he should
follow
His rash oath or the sweet compassion
Of those two ladies. And, to second them,
That truly noble prince, Pirithous--
Half his own heart--set in too, that I hope
All shall be well. Neither heard I one question
Of your name or his 'scape.

JAILER  Pray heaven it hold so.

[Enter Second Friend.]
