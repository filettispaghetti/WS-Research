For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,
And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,
And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,
The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
That makes these odds all even.
CLAUDIO
I humbly thank you.
To sue to live, I find I seek to die;
And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.
ISABELLA
[Within] What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!
Provost
Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
CLAUDIO
Most holy sir, I thank you.
Enter ISABELLA

ISABELLA
My business is a word or two with Claudio.
Provost
And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Provost, a word with you.
Provost
As many as you please.
DUKE VINCENTIO
Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.
Exeunt DUKE VINCENTIO and Provost

CLAUDIO
Now, sister, what's the comfort?
