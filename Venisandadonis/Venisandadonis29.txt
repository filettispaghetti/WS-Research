She whispers in his ears a heavy tale
As if they heard the woeful words she told.
  She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,
  Where, lo, two lamps, burnt out, in darkness lies.

Two glasses, where herself herself beheld
A thousand times, and now no more reflect,
Their virtue lost, wherein they late excelled,
And every beauty robbed of his effect.
  "Wonder of time," quoth she, "this is my spite,
  That, thou being dead, the day should yet be light.

"Since thou art dead, lo, here I prophesy
Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend;
It shall be waited on with jealousy,
Find sweet beginning but unsavory end,
  Ne'er settled equally, but high or low,
  That all love's pleasure shall not match his woe.

"It shall be fickle, false, and full of fraud,
Bud and be blasted in a breathing while,
The bottom poison and the top o'erstrawed
With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile;
  The strongest body shall it make most weak,
  Strike the wise dumb, and teach the fool to speak.

"It shall be sparing and, too, full of riot,
Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures;
The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet,
Pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures.
  It shall be raging mad and silly mild,
  Make the young old, the old become a child.

"It shall suspect where is no cause of fear;
It shall not fear where it should most mistrust.
It shall be merciful and, too, severe,
And most deceiving when it seems most just.
  Perverse it shall be where it shows most toward,
  Put fear to valor, courage to the coward.

"It shall be cause of war and dire events,
And set dissension 'twixt the son and sire;
Subject and servile to all discontents,
As dry combustious matter is to fire.
  Sith in his prime Death doth my love destroy,
  They that love best their loves shall not enjoy."

By this the boy that by her side lay killed
Was melted like a vapor from her sight,
And in his blood that on the ground lay spilled
