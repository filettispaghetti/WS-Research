Or stonished, as night wand'rers often are,
Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood,
  Even so confounded in the dark she lay,
  Having lost the fair discovery of her way.

And now she beats her heart, whereat it groans,
That all the neighbor caves, as seeming troubled,
Make verbal repetition of her moans.
Passion on passion deeply is redoubled.
  "Ay me!" she cries, and twenty times, "Woe, woe!"
  And twenty echoes twenty times cry so.

She marking them begins a wailing note
And sings extemporally a woeful ditty
How love makes young men thrall and old men dote,
How love is wise in folly, foolish witty.
  Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe,
  And still the choir of echoes answer so.

Her song was tedious and outwore the night,
For lovers' hours are long, though seeming short.
If pleased themselves, others they think delight
In suchlike circumstance with suchlike sport.
  Their copious stories, oftentimes begun,
  End without audience and are never done.

For who hath she to spend the night withal
But idle sounds resembling parasits,
Like shrill-tongued tapsters answering every call,
Soothing the humor of fantastic wits?
  She says, "'Tis so," they answer all, "'Tis so,"
  And would say after her if she said "No."

Lo, here the gentle lark, weary of rest,
From his moist cabinet mounts up on high
And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast
The sun ariseth in his majesty,
  Who doth the world so gloriously behold
  That cedar tops and hills seem burnished gold.

Venus salutes him with this fair good morrow:
"O thou clear god and patron of all light,
From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow
The beauteous influence that makes him bright,
  There lives a son that sucked an earthly mother
  May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other."

This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,
Musing the morning is so much o'erworn,
And yet she hears no tidings of her love;
