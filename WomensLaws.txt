See here the reason of that which I touched before, that women have no voice 
in Parliament, they make no laws; they consent to none; they abrogate none. All
 of them are understood either married or to be married, and their desires
 subject to their husband. I know no remedy, though some women can shift it well enough.
 The Common Law here shaketh hand[s] with Divinity.
