God heauenly Father, which by
thy Sonne Jesu# Christ, hast
promised to all them that seeke thy
Kingdome and the righteousnesse
therof, all thing# necessary to their
bodily sustenance : Send v#, we
beseech thee, in thi# our necessitie,
such moderate raine and showre#,
that we may receiue the fruit# of
the earth to our comfort and to thy
honour, through Jesu# Christ our
Lord. Amen.
¶ For fair weather.
Lord God, which for the sinne of man diddest
once drown all the world, except eight person#,
and afterward of thy great mercy diddest
promise neuer to destroy it so again : we
humbly beseech thee, that although we for our
iniquitie# haue worthily deserued thi# plague
of raine and water#; yet vpon our true
repentance, thou wilt send v# such weather, whereby we may
receiue the fruit# of the earth in due season, and learn both by
thy punishment to amend our liue#, and for thy clemency to
giue thee praise and glory, through Jesu# Christ our Lord.
Amen.
¶ In the time of dearth and famine.
God heauenly Father, whose gift it i# that the
raine doth fall, the earth i# fruitfull, beast#
encrease, and fishe# do multiply : Behold, we
beseech thee, the affliction# of thy people, and
grant that the scarcitie and dearth (which we do 
now most iustly suffer for our iniquitie) may through thy
goodnesse be mercifully turned into cheapnesse and plenty, for
the loue of Jesu# Christ our Lord, to whom with thee and the
holy Ghost be Praise for euer. Amen.
¶ In the time of Warre.
Almighty God, King of all King#, and
gouernour of all thing#, whose power no
creature i# able to resist, to whom it
belongeth iustly to punish sinner#, and to
bee mercifull vnto them that truely
repent, saue, and deliuer v# (we humbly
beseech thee) from the hand# of our
enemie#, abate their pride, asswage their
malice, and confound their deuise#, that
we being armed with thy defence, may be preserued euermore
from all peril# to glorifie thee, which art the onely giuer of all
victory, through the merit# of thy onely Sonne Jesu# Christ
our Lord. Amen.
