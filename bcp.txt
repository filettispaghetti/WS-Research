Proclamation of the Word of God and
Celebration of the Holy Communion>

<An Exhortation>
 
*This Exhortation may be used, in whole or in part, either during the
Liturgy or at other times.  In the absence of a deacon or priest, this
Exhortation may be read by a lay person.  The people stand or sit.*
 
Beloved in the Lord: Our Savior Christ, on the night before
he suffered, instituted the Sacrament of his Body and
Blood as a sign and pledge of his love, for the continual
remembrance of the sacrifice of his death, and for a spiritual
sharing in his risen life.  For in these holy Mysteries we are
made one with Christ, and Christ with us; we are made one
body in him, and members one of another.
 
Having in mind, therefore, his great love for us, and in
obedience to his command, his Church renders to Almighty
God our heavenly Father never-ending thanks for the
creation of the world, for his continual providence over us,
for his love for all mankind, and for the redemption of the
world by our Savior Christ, who took upon himsely our flesh,
and humbled himself even to death on the cross, that he
might make us the children of God by the power of the Holy
Spirit, and exalt us to everlasting life.
 
But if we are to share rightly in the celebration of those holy
Mysteries, and be nourished by that spritual Food, we must remember
the dignity of that holy Sacrament.  I therefore call
upon you to consider how Saint Paul exhorts all persons to
prepare themselves carefully before eating of that Bread and
drinking of that Cup.
 
For, as the benefit is great, if with penitent hearts and living
faith we receive the holy Sacrament, so is the danger great, if
we receive it improperly, not recognizing the Lord'sbeing
ready to make restitution for all injuries and wrongs done by
you to others; and also being ready to forgive those who have
offended you, in order that you yourselves may be forgiven.
And then, being reconciled with one another, come to the
banquet of that most heavenly Food.
 
And if, in your preparation, you need help and counsel, then
go and open your grief to a discreet and understanding priest,
and confess your sins, that you may receive the benefit of
absolution, and spiritual counsel and advice; to the removal
of scruple and doubt, the assurance of pardon, and the
strengthening of your faith.
 
To Christ our Lord who loves us, and washed us in his own
blood, and made us a kingdom of priests to serve his God
and Father, to him be glory in the Church evermore.  Through
him let us offer continually the sacrifice of praise, which is
our bounden duty and service, and, with faith in him, come
boldly before the throne of grace [and humbly confess our
sins to Almighty God].

<A Penitential Order: Rite One>
 
*For use at the beginning of the Liturgy, or as a separate service.*
 
*A hymn, psalm, or anthem may be sung.*
 
 
*The people standing, the Celebrant says*
 
Blessed be God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
 
*People*  And blessed be his kingdom, now and for ever.  Amen.
 
 
*In place of the above, from Easter Day through the Day of Pentecost*
 
*Celebrant*  Alleluia.  Christ is risen.
 
*People*  The Lord is risen indeed.  Alleluia.
 
 
*In Lent and on other penitential occasions*

*The Celebrant may read one of the following sentences*
 
Hear what our Lord Jesus saith:
 
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with
all thy soul, and with all thy mind.  This is the first and great
commandment.  And the second is like unto it:  Thou shalt
love thy neighbor as thyself.  On these two commandments
hang all the Law and the Prophets.  =Matthew 22:37-40=
 
<page 320>
 
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
truth is not in us; but if we confess our sins, God is faithful
and just to forgive our sins, and cleanse us from all
unrighteousness.  =1 John 1:8,9=
 
Seeing that we have a great heigh priest, that is passed into the
heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us come boldly unto the
throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to
help in time of need.  =Hebrews 4:14,16=
 
 
*The Deacon or Celebrant then says*
 
Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
 
*Silence may be kept.*
 
 
*Minister and People*
 
Most merciful God,we confess that we have sinned against thee
in thought, word, and deed,
by what we have done,
and by what we have lefred and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep,
we have followed too much the devices and desires of our
/own hearts,
<page 321>
we have offended against thy holy laws,
we have left undone those things which we ought to
/have done,
and we have done those things which we ought not to
/have done.
But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us,
spare thou those who confess their faults,
restore thou those who are penitent,
according to thy promises declared unto mankind
in Christ Jesus our Lord;
and grand, O most merciful Father, for his sake,
that we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life,
to the glory of thy holy Name.  Amen.

remission of all your sins, true repentance, amendment of
life, and the grace and consolation of his Holy Spirit.  =Amen.=

"you" and "our" for "your."*
 
*When this Order is used at the beginning of the Liturgy, the service
continues with the Kyrie eleison, the Trisagion, or the Gloria in
excelsis.*
 
*When used separately, it concludes with suitable prayers, and the Grace
or a blessing.*
 
<page 322>
 
 
<Concerning the Celebration>
 
*It is the bishop's prerogative, when present, to be the principal
celebrant at the Lord's Table, and to preach the Gospel.*
 
*At all celebrations of the Liturgy, it is fitting that the principal
celebrant, whether bishop or priest, be assisted by other priests, and
by deacons and lay persons.*
 
*It is appropriate that other priests present stand with the celebrant
at the Altar, and join in the consecration of the gifts, in breaking the
Bread, and in distributing Communion.*
 
*A deacon should read the Gospel and may lead the Prayers of the People.
Deacons should also serve at the Lord's Table, preparing and placing on
it the offerings of bread and wine, and assisting in the ministration of
the sacrament to the people.  In the absence of a deacon, these duties
may be performed by an assisting priest.*
 
*Lay persons appointed by the celebrant should normally be assigned the
reading of the Lessons which precede the Gospel, and may lead the
Prayers of the People.*
 
*Morning or Evening Prayer may be used in place of all that precedes the
Peace and the Offertory, provided that a lesson from the Gospel is
always included, and that the intercessions conform to the directions
given for the Prayers of the People.*
 
*Additional Directions are on page 406.*

*In Lent and on other penitential occasions*
 
*Celebrant*  Bless the Lord who forgiveth all our sins;
 
*People*  His mercy endureth for ever.
 
 
*The Celebrant says*
 
Almighty God, unto whom all hearts are open, all desires
known, and from whom no secrets are hid:  Cleanse the
thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of thy Holy Spirit,
that we may perfectly love thee, and worthily magnify thy
holy Name; through Christ our Lord.  =Amen.=
 
<page 324>
 
*Then the Ten Commandments may be said, or the following*
 
Hear what our Lord Jesus Christ saith:
 
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with
all thy soul, and with all thy mind.  This is the first and great
commandment.  And the second is like unto it:  Thou shalt
love thy neighbor as thyself.  On these two commandments
hang all the Law and the Prophets.

  receive our prayer.
Thou that sittest at the right hand of God the Father, have mercy upon
us.
 
For thou only art holy;
thou only art the Lord;
thou only, O Christ,
  with the Holy Ghost,
  art most high in the glory of God the Father.  =Amen.=
 
 
<The Collect of the Day>
 
 
*The Celebrant says to the people*
 
The Lord be with you.
 
*People*  And with thy spirit.

<The Sermon>
 
*On Sundays and other Major Feasts there follows, all standing The
Nicene Creed*
 
We believe in one God,
  the Father, the Almighty,
  maker of heaven and earth,
  of all that is, seen and unseen.
 
We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,
  the only Son of God,
  eternally begotten of the Father,
  God from God, Light from Light,
  true God from true God,
  begotten, not made,
  of one Being with the Father.
  Through him all things were made.
  For us and for our salvation
      he came down from heaven:
<page 326>
  by the power of the Holy Spirit
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,
  and was made man.
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;
  he suffered death and was buried.
  On the third day he rose again
    in accordance with the Scriptures;
  he ascended into heavan
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,
    and his kingdom will have no end.
 
We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,
  who proceeds from the Father and the Son.
  With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.
  He has spoken through the Prophets.
  We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.
  We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
  We look for the resurrection of the dead,
    and the life of the world to come.  Amen.
 
*or this*
 
I believe in one God,
    the Father Almighty,
    maker of heaven and earth,
and of all things visible and invisible;
 
And in one Lord Jesus Christ,
    the only-begotten Son of God,
begotten of his Father before all worlds,
    God of God, Light of Light,
    very God of very God,
    begotten, not made,
<page 328>
    being of one substance with the Father;
    by whom all things were made;
    who for us men and for our salvation
        came down from heaven,
and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary,
        and was made man;
    and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate;
    he suffered and was buried;
and the third day he rose again according to the Scriptures,
    and ascended into heaven,
    and sitteth on the right hand of the Father;
    and he shall come again, with glory,
        to judge both the quick and the dead;
    whose kingdom shall have no end.
And I believe in the Holy Ghost the Lord, and Giver of Life, who
proceedeth from the Father and the Son;
    who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped
        and glorified;
    who spake by the Prophets.
    And I believe one holy Catholic and Apostolic Church;
I acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins;
    and I look for the resurrection of the dead,
        and the life of the world to come.  =Amen.=

Let us pray for the whole state of Christ's Church and the world.
 
 
*After each paragraph of this prayer, the People may make an appropriate
response, as directed.*
 
<page 329>
 
Almighty and everliving God, who in thy holy Word hast
taught us to make prayers, and supplications, and to give
thanks for all men:  Receive these our prayers which we offer
unto thy divine Magesty, beseeching thee to inspire
continually the Universal Church with the spirit of truth,
unity, and concord; and grant that all those who do confess
thy holy Name may agree in the truth of thy holy Word, and
live in unity and godly love.
 
Give grace, O heavenly Father, to all bishops and other
ministers [especially &mdash.], that they may, both by
their life and doctrine, set forth thy true and lively Word,
and rightly and duly administer thy holy Sacraments.
 
And to all thy people give thy heavenly grace, and especially
to this congregation here present; that, with meek heart and
due reverence, they may hear and receive thy holy Word,
truly serving thee in holiness and righteousness all the days
of their life.
 
We beseech thee also so to rule the hearts of those who bear
the authority of government in this and every land [especially
&mdash.], that they may be led to wise decisions and right
actions for the welfare and peace of the world.
 
Open, O Lord, the eyes of all people to behold thy gracious
hand in all thy works,
departed this life in thy faith and fear [especially &mdash.],
beseeching thee to grant them continual growth in thy love
and service; and to grant us grace so to follow the good
examples of [&mdash. and of] all thy saints, that with
them we may be partakers of thy heavenly kingdom.
 
Grant these our prayers, O Father, for Jesus Christ's sake,
our only Mediator and Advocate.  =Amen.=
 
 
*If there is no celebration of the Communion, or if a priest is not
available, the service is concluded as directed page 406.*
 
 
<Confession of Sin>
 
*A Confession of Sin is said here if it has not been said earlier.  On
occasion, the Confession may be omitted.*
 
*The Deacon or Celebrant says the following, or else the Exhortation
page 316.*
 
Ye who do truly and earnestly repent you of your sins, and
are in love and charity with your neighbors, and intend to
lead a new life, following the commandments of God, and
walking from henceforth in his holy ways:  Draw near with
faith, and make your humble confession to Almighty God,
devoutly kneeling.
 
*or this*
 
Let us humbly confess our sins unto Almighty God.
 
*Silence may be kept.*
 
<page 331>
 
*Minister and People*
 
Almighty God,
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
maker of all things, judge of all men:
We acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins
/and wickedness,
which we from time to time most grievously have committed,
by thought, word, and deed, against thy divine Majesty,
provoking most justly thy wrath and indignation against us.
We do earnestly repent,
and are heartily sorry for these our misdoings;
the remembrance of them is grievous unto us,
the burden of them is intolerable.
Have mercy upon us,
have mercy upon us, most merciful Father;
for thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ's sake,
forgive us all that is past;
and grant that we may ever hereafter
serve and please thee in newness of life,
to the honor and glory of thy Name;
through Jesus Christ our Lord.  =Amen.=
 
*or this*
 
Most merciful God,
we confess that we have sinned against thee
in thought, word, and deed,
by what we have done,
and by what we have left undone.
We have not loved thee with our whole heart;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.
For the sake of thy Son Jesus Christ,
have mercy on us and forgive us;
that we may delight in thy will,
and walk in thy ways,
to the glory of thy Name.  =Amen.=
 
<page 332>
 
*The Bishop when present, or the Priest, stands and says*
 
Almighty God, our heavenly Father, who of his great mercy
hath promised forgiveness of sins to all those who with
hearty repentance and true faith turn unto him, have mercy
upon you, pardon and deliver you from all your sins, confirm
and strengthen you in all goodness, and bring you to
everlasting life; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  =Amen.=
 
 
*A Minister may then say one or more of the following sentences, first
saying*
 
Hear the Word of God to all who truly turn to him.
 
Come unto me, all ye that travail and are heavy laden, and I will
refresh you.  =Matthew 11:28=
 
God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son,
to the end that all that believe in him should not perish, but
have everlasting life.  =John 3:16=
 
This is a true saying, and worthy of all men to be received,
that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.
=I Timothy 1:15=
 
If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ the righteous; and he is the perfect offering for our
sins, and not for ours only, but for the sins of the whole
world.  =I John 2:1-2=
 
 
<The Peace>
 
*All stand.  The Celebrant says to the people*
 
The peace of the Lord be always with you.
 
*People*  And with thy spirit.
 
 
*Then the Ministers and People may greet one another in the name of the
Lord.*
 
<page 333>
 
 
<The Holy Communion>
 
*The Celebrant may begin y or other gifts, to the deacon or celebrant.
The people stand while the offerings are presented and placed on the
Altar.*
 
 
<The Great Thanksgiving>
 
*An alternative form will be found on page 340.*
 
 
<Eucharistic Prayer I>
 
*The people remain standing.  The Celebrant, whether bishop or priest,
faces them and sings or says*
 
The Lord be with you.
 
*People*  And with thy spirit.
 
*Celebrant*  Lift up your hearts.
 
*People*  We lift them up unto the Lord.
 
*Celebrant*  Let us give thanks unto our Lord God.
 
*People*  It is meet and right so to do.
 
 
*Then, facing the Holy Table, the Celebrant proceeds*
 
It is very meet, right, and our bounden duty, that we should
at all times, and in all places, give thanks unto thee, O Lord,
holy Father, almighty, everlasting God.
 
<page 334>
 
*Here a Proper Preface is sung or said on all Sundays, and on other
occasions as appointed.*
 
Therefore with Angels and Archangels, and with all the
company of heaven, we laud and magnify thy glorious
Name; evermore praising thee, and saying,
 
*Celebrant and People*
 
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts:
Heaven and earth are full of thy Glory.
Glory be to thee, O Lord Most High.
 
*Here may be added*
 
Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the highest.
 
 
*The people kneel or stand.*
 
*Then the Celebrant continues*
 
All glory be to thee, Almighty God, our heavenly Father, for
that thou, of thy tender mercy, didst give thine only Son Jesus
Christ to suffer death upon the cross for our redemption; who
made there, by his one oblation of himself once offered, a full,
perfect, and sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction, for
the sins of the whole world; and did institute, and in his holy
Gospel command us to continue, a perpetual memory of that
his precious death and sacrifice, until his coming again.
 
*At the following words concerning the bread, the Celebrant is to hold
it, or lay a hand upon it; and at the words concerning the cup, to hold
or place a hand upon the cup and any other vessel containing wine to be
consecrated*
 
For in the night in which he was betrayed, he took bread;
and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and gave it to his
<page 335>
disciples, saying, "Take, eat, this is my Body, which is given for
you.  Do this in remembrance of me."
 
Likewise, after supper, he took the cup; and when he had
given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, "Drink ye all of this;
for this is my Blood of the New Testament, which is shed for
you, and for many, for the remission of sins. Do this, as oft as
ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me."
 
Wherefore, O Lord and heavenly Father, according to the
institution of thy dearly beloved Son our Savior Jesus Christ,
we, thy humble servants, do celebrate and make here before
thy divine Majesty, with these thy holy gifts, which we now
offer unto thee, the memorial thy Son hath commanded us to
make; having in remembrance his blessed passion and precious
death, his mighty resurrection and glorious ascension;
rendering unto thee most hearty thanks for the innumerable
benefits procured unto us by the same.
 
And we most humbly beseech thee, O merciful Father, to
hear us; and, of thy almighty goodness, vouchsafe to bless
and sanctify, with thy Word and Holy Spirit, these thy gifts
and creatures of bread and wine; that we, receiving them
according to thy Son our Savior Jesus Christ's holy institution,
in remembrance of his death and passion, may be partakers
of his most blessed Body and Blood.
 
And we earnestly desire thy fatherly goodness mercifully to
accept this our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; most
humbly beseeching thee to grant that, by the merits and
death of thy Son Jesus Christ, and through faith in his blood,
we, and all thy whole Church, may obtain remission of our
sins, and all other benefits of his passion.
 
<page 336>
 
And here we offer and present unto thee, O Lord, our selves,
our souls and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy, and living
sacrifice unto thee; humbly beseeching thee that we, and all
others who shall be partakers of this Holy Communion, may
worthily receive the most precious Body and Blood of thy Son
Jesus Christ, be filled with thy grace and heavenly benediction,
and made one body with him, that he may dwell in us, and
we in him.
 
And although we are unworthy, through our manifold sins,
to off
all honor and glory be unto thee, O Father Almighty, world
without end.  AMEN.
 
 
And now, as our Savior Christ hath taught us, we are bold
to say,
 
*People and Celebrant*
 
Our Father, who art in heaven,
  hallowed be thy Name,
  thy kingdom come,
  thy will be done,
    on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
  as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
  but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and
ever.  =Amen.=
 
<page 337>
 
 
<The Breaking of the Bread>
 
*The Celebrant breaks the consecrated Bread.*
 
*A period of silence is kept.*
 
 
*Then may be sung or said*
 
[Alleluia.]  Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us;
Therefore let us keep the feast.  [Alleluia.]
 
*In Lent, Alleluia is omitted, and may be omitted at other times except
during Easter Season.*
 
*The following or some other suitable anthem may be sung or said here*
 
O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world,
have mercy upon us.
 
O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world,
have mercy upon us.
 
O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world,
grant us thy peace.
 
 
*The following prayer may be said.  The People may join in saying this
prayer*
 
We do not presume to come to this thy Table, O merciful
Lord, trusting in our own righteousness, but in thy manifold
and great mercies.  We are not worthy so much as to gather
up the crumbs under thy Table.  But thou art the same Lord
whose property is always to have mercy.  Grant us therefore,
gracious Lord, so to eat the flesh of thy dear Son Jesus Christ,
and to drink his blood, that we may evermore dwell in him,
and he in us.  =Amen.=
 
<page 338>
 
*Facing the people, the Celebrant may say the following Invitation*
 
The Gifts of God for the People of God.
 
*and may add*
 
Take them in remembrance that Christ died for you, and
feed on him in your hearts by faith, with thanksgiving.
 
*The ministers receive the Sacrament in both kinds, and then immediately
deliver it to the people*
 
 
*The Bread and the Cup are given to the communicants with these words*
 
The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was given for thee,
preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life.  Take and eat
this in remembrance that  Christ died for thee, and feed on
him in thy heart by faith, with thanksgiving.
 
The Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was shed for thee,
preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life.  Drink this in
remembrance that Christ's Blood was shed for thee, and be
thankful.
 
*or with these words*
 
The Body (Blood) of our Lord Jesus Christ keep you in
everlasting life.  [=Amen.=]
 
*or with these words*
 
The Body of Christ, the bread of heaven.  [=Amen.=]
 
The Blood of Christ, the cup of salvation.  [=Amen.=]
 
 
*During the ministration of Communion, hymns, psalms, or anthems may be
sung.*
 
*When necessary, the Celebrant consecrates additional bread and wine,
using the form on page 408.*
 
 
*After Communion, the Celebrant says*
 
Let us pray.
 
*The People may join in saying this prayer*
 
Almighty and everliving God, we most heartily thank thee
for that thou dost feed us, in these holy mysteries, with the
spiritual food of the most precious Body and Blood of thy
Son our Savior Jesus Christ; and dost assure us thereby of
thy favor and goodness towards us; and that we are very
members incorporate in the mystical body of thy Son, the
blessed company of all faithful people; and are also heirs,
through hope, of thy everlasting kingdom.  And we humbly
beseech thee, O heavenly Father, so to assist us with thy
grace, that we may continue in that holy fellowship, and do
all such good works as thou hast prepared for us to walk in;
through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with Son Jesus Christ our Lord; and the blessing of
God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, be
amongst you, and remain with you always.  =Amen.=
 
*or this*
 
The blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Spirit, be upon you and remain with you for ever.  =Amen.=
 
 
*The Deacon, or the Celebrant, may dismiss the people with these words*
 
Let us go forth in the name of Christ.
 
*People*  Thanks be to God.

<Alternative Form

<Eucharistic Prayer II>
 
*The people remain standing.  The Celebrant, whether bishop or priest,
faces them and sings or says*
 
The Lord be with you.
 
*People*  And with thy spirit.
 
*Celebrant*  Lift up your hearts.
 
*People*  We lift them up unto the Lord.
 
*Celebrant*  Let us give thanks unto our Lord God.
 
*People*  It is meet and right so to do.
 
<page 341>
 
*Then, facing the Holy Table, the Celbrant proceeds*
 
It is very mee, right, and our bounden duty, that we should
at all times, and in all places, give thanks unto thee, O Lord,
holy Father, almighty, everlasting God.
 
 
*Here a Proper Preface is sung or said on all Sundays, and on other
occasions as appointed.*
 
Therefore with Angels and Archangels, and with all the
company of heaven, we laud and magnify thy glorious
Name; evermore praising thee, and saying,
 
 
*Celebrant and People*
 
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts:
Heaven and earth are full of thy glory.
Glory be to thee, O Lord Most High.
 
*Here may be added*
 
Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the highest.
 
 
*The people kneel or stand.*
 
*Then the Celebrant continues*
 
All glory be to thee, O Lord our God, for that thou didst
create heaven and earth, and didst make us in thine own
image; and, of thy tender mercy, didst give thine only Son
Jesus Christ to take our nature upon him, and to suffer death
upon the cross for our redemption.  He made there a full and
perfect sacrifice for the whole world; and did institute, and in
his holy Gospel command us to continue, a perpetual
memory of that his precious death and sacrifice, until his
coming again.
 
<page 342>
 
*At the following words concerning the bread, the Celebrant is to hold
it, or lay a hand upon it; and at the words concerning the cup, to hold
or place a hand upon the cup and any other vessel containing wine to be
consecrated*
 
For in the night in which he was betrayed, he took bread;
and when he had given thanks to thee, he broke it, and gave it
to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat, this is my Body, which is
given for you.  Do this in remembrance of me."
 
Likewise, after supper, he took the cup; and when he had
given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, "Drink this, all of
you; for this is my Blood of the New Covenant, which is shed
for you, and for many, for the remission of sins.  Do this, as
oft as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me."
 
Wherefore, O Lord and heavenly Father, we thy people do
celebrate and make, with these thy holy gifts which we now
offer unto thee, the memorial thy Son hath commanded us to
make; having in remembrance his blessed passion and precious
death, his mighty resurrection and glorious ascension; and
looking for his coming again with power and great glory.
 
And we most humbly beseech thee, O merciful Father, to
hear us, and, with thy Word and Holy Spirit, to bless and
sanctify these gifts of bread and wine, that they may be unto
us the Body and Blood of thy dearly-beloved Son Jesus
Christ.
 
And we earnestly desire thy fatherly goodness to accept this
our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving, whereby we offer
and present unto thee, O Lord, our selves, our souls and
bodies.  Grant, we beseech thee, that all who partake of this
Holy Communion may worthily receive the most precious
Body and Blood of thy Son Jesus Christ, and be filled with
thy grace and heavenly benediction; and also that we and all
thy whole Church may be made one body with him, that he
<page 343>
may dwell in us, and we in him; through the same Jesus
Christ our Lord;
 
By whome, and with whom, and in whom, in the unity of the
Holy Ghost all honor and glory be unto thee, O Father
Almighty, world without end.  AMEN.
 
And now, as our Savior Christ hath taught us, we are bold
to say,
 
*Continue with the Lord's Prayer be used*
 
Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and make good thy
vows unto the Most High.  =Psalm 50:14=
 
Ascribe to the Lord the honor due his Name; bring offerings
and come into his courts.  =Psalm 96:8=
 
Walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself for us, an
offering and sacrifice to God.  =Ephesians 5:2=
 
I beseech you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present
yourselves as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God,
which is your spiritual worship.  =Romans 12:1=
 
If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that
thy brother hath aught against thee, leave there thy gift
before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy
brother, and then come and offer thy gift.  =Matthew 5:23,24=
 
<page 344>
 
Through Christ let us continually offer to God the sacrifice of
praise, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his Name.
But to do good and to distribute, forget not; for with such
sacrifices God is well pleased.  =Hebrews 13:15,16=
 
Worthy art thou, O Lord our God, to receive glory and honor
and power; for thou hast created all things, and by thy will
they were created and have their being.  =Revelation 4:11=
 
Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory,
and the victory, and the majesty.  For all that is in the heaven
and in the earth is thine.  Thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and
thou art exalted as head above all.  =1 Chronicles 29:11=
 
*or this bidding*
 
Let us with gladness present the offerings and oblations of
our life and labor to the Lord.

Blessed be God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
 
*People*  And blessed be his kPentecost*

*People*  His mercy endures for ever.
 
 
*When used as a separate service, the Exhortation, page 316, may be
read, or a homily preached.*
 
*The Decalogue may be said, the people kneeling.*
 
*The Celebrant may read one of the following sentences*
 
Jesus said, "The first commandments is this: Hear, O Israel:
The Lord your God is the only Lord.  Love the Lord your
God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your
mind, and with all your strength.  The second is this: Love
your neighbor as yourself.  There is no commandment
greater than these."   =Mark 12:29-31=
 
<page 352>
 
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
truth is not in us.  But if we confess our sins, God, who is
faithful and just, will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all
unrighteousness.  =1 John 1:8,9=
 
Since we have a great high priest who has pased through the
heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us with confidence draw
near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and
find grace to help in time of need.   =Hebrews 4:14,16=
 
 
*The Deacon or Celebrant then says*
 
Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
 
*Silence may be kept.*
 
 
*Minister and People*
 
Most merciful God,we confess that we have sinned against you
in thought, word, and deed,
by what we have done,
and by what we have left undone.
We have not loved you with our whole heart;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,
have mercy on us and forgive us;
that we may delight in your will,
and walk in your ways,
to the glory of your Name.  Amen.
 
<page 353>
 
*The Bishop when present, or the Priest, stands and says*
 
Almighty God have mercy on you, forgive you all your sins
through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen you in all

"you" and "our" for "your."*
 
*When this Order is used at the beginning of the Liturgy, the service
continues with the Gloria in excelsis, the Kyrie eleison, or the
Trisagion.*
 
*When used separately, it concludes with suitable prayers, and the Grace
or a blessing.*
 
<page 354>
 
 
<Concerning the Celebration>
 
*It is the bishop's prerogative, when present, to be the principal
celebrant at the Lord's Table, and to preach the Gospel.*
 
*At all celebrations of the Liturgy, it is fitting that the principal
celebrant, whether bishop or priest, be assisted by other priests, and
by deacons and lay persons.*
 
*It is appropriate that other priests present stand with the celebrant
at the Altar, and join in the consecration of the gifts, in breaking the
Bread, and in distributing Communion.*
 
*A deacon should read the Gospel and may lead the Prayers of the People.
Deacons should also serve at the Lord's Table, preparing and placing on
it the offerings of bread and wine, and assisting in the ministration of
the sacrament to the people.  In the absence of a deacon, these duties
may be performed by an assisting priest.*
 
*Lay persons appointed by the celebrant should normally be assigned the
reading of the Lessons which precede the Gospel, and may lead the
Prayers of the People.*
 
*Morning or Evening Prayer may be used in place of all that precedes the
Peace and the Offertory, provided that a lesson from the Gospel is
always included, and that the intercessions conform to the directions
given for the Prayers of the People.*
 
*Additional Directions are on page 406.*

<The Nicene Creed>
 
We believe in one God,
 the Father, the Almighty,
 maker of heaven and earth,
 of all that is, seen and unseen.
 
We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,
 the only Son of God,
 eternally begotten of the Father,
 God from God, Light from Light,
 true God from true God,
 begotten, not made,
 of one Being with the Father.
 Through him all things were made.
 For us and for our salvation
  he came down from heaven:
 by the power of the Holy Spirit
  he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,
  and was made man.
 For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;
  he suffered death and was buried.
 On the third day he rose again
  in accordance with the Scriptures;
 he ascended into heaven
  and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
<page 359>
 He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,
  and his kingdom will have no end.
 
We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,
 who proceeds from the Father and the Son.
 With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.
 He has spoken through the Prophets.
 We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.
 We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
 We look for the resurrection of the dead,
  and the life of the world to come.  Amen.

  The Universal Church, its members, and its mission
 
  The Nation and all in authority
 
  The welfare of the world
 
  The concerns of the local community
 
  Those who suffer and those in any tron page 383.*
 
*If there is no celebration of the Communion, or if a priest is not
available, the service is concluded as directed on page 406.*
 
 
<Confession of Sin>

<page 360>
 
*The Deacon or Celebrant says*
 
Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
 
*Silence may be kept.*
 
*Minister and People*
 
Most merciful God,
we confess that we have sinned against you
in thought, word, and deed,
by what we have done,
and by what we have left undone.
We have not loved you with our whole heart;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves. We are truly sorry and we
humbly repent. For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,
have mercy on us and forgive us;
that we may delight in your will,
and walk in your ways,
to the glory of your Name.  Amen.
 
 
*The Bishop, when present, or the Priest, stands and says*
 
Almighty God have mercy on you, forgive you all your sins
through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen you in all
goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep you in
eternal life.  =Amen.=
 
 
<The Peace>

Lord.*
 
<page 363>

376, or with some other sentence of Scripture.*
 
*During the Offertory, a hymn, psalm, or anthem may be sung.*
 
*Representatives of the congregation bring the people's offerings of
bread and wine, and money or other gifts, to the deacon or celebrant.
The people stand while the offerings are presented and placed on the
Altar.*
 
 
<The Great Thanksgiving>
 
*Alternative forms will be found on page 367 and following.*
 
 
<Eucharistic Prayer A>
 
*The people remain standing.  The Celebrant, whether bishop or priest,
faces them and sings or says*
 
The Lord be with you.
 
*People*   And also with you.
 
*Celebrant*   Lift up your hearts.
 
*People*   We lift them to the Lord.
 
*Celebrant*   Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
 
*People*   It is right to give him thanks and praise.
 
 
*Then, facing the Holy Table, the Celebrant proceeds*
 
It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and every-
where to give thanks to you, Father Almighty, Creator of
heaven and earth.
 
*Here a Proper Preface is sung or said on all Sundays, and on other
occasions as appointed.*
 
<page 362>
 
Therefore we praise you, joining our voices with Angels and
Archangels and with all the company of heaven, who for ever
sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your Name:
 
 
*Celebrant and People*
 
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord, God of power and might,
heaven and earth are full of your glory.
  Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
  Hosanna in the highest.
 
*The people stand or kneel.*
 
 
*Then the Celebrant continues*
 
Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us
for yourself, and, when we had fallen into sin and become
subject to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus
Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human
nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the
God and Father of all.
 
He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself,
in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole
world.
 
*At the following words concerning the bread, the Celebrant is to hold
it, or to lay a hand upon it; and at the words concerning the cup, to
hold or place a hand upon the cup and any other vessel containing wine
to be consecrated.*
 
On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our
Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks
to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, "Take,
eat: This is my Body, which is given for you.  Do this for the
remembrance of me."
 
<page 363>
 
After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given
thanks, he gave it to them, and said, "Drink this, all of you:
This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you
and for many for the forgiveness of sins.  Whenever you drink
it, do this for the remembrance of me."
 
Therefore we proclaim the mystery of faith:
 
*Celebrant and People*
 
Christ has died.
 
Christ is risen.
 
Christ will come again.
 
 
*The Celebrant continues*
 
We celebrate the memorial of our redemption, O Father, in
this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving.  Recalling his death,
resurrection, and ascension, we offer you these gifts.
 
Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be for your people the
Body and Blood of your Son, the holy food and drink of new
and unending life in him.  Sanctify us also that we may faithfully
receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy,
and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints
into the joy of your eternal kingdom.

We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love
which you have made known to us in creation; in the calling
of Israel to be your people; in your Word spoken through the
prophets; and above all in the Word made flesh, Jesus, your
Son.  For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate from
the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world.
In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy
to stand before you.  In him, you have brought us out of error
into truth, out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.
 
*At the following words concerning the bread, the Celebrant is to hold
it, or to lay a hand upon it; and at the words concerning the cup, to
hold or place a hand upon the cup and any other vessel containing wine
to be consecrated.*
 
On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took
bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and
gave it to his disciples, and said, "Take, eat: This is my Body,
which is given for you.  Do this for the remembrance of me."
 
After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given
thanks, he gave it to them, and said, "Drink this, all of you:
This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you
and for many for the forgiveness of sins.  Whenever you drink
it, do this for the remembrance of me."
 
Therefore, according to his command, O Father,
 
*Celebrant and People*
 
We remember his death,
We proclaim his resurrection,
We await his coming in glory;
 
<pd of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this
bread and this wine.
 
We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon
these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of
Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant.  Unite us to your
Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him,
being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.  In the fullness of time,
put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to
that heavenly country where, with [&mdash. and] all your
saints, we may enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and
daughters; through Jesus Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all
creation, the head of the Church, and the author of our
salvation.
 
By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy
Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and
for ever.  =AMEN.=

*Then, facing the Holy Table, the Celebrant proceeds*
 
God of all power, Ruler of the Universe, you are worthy of

=Glory to you for ever and ever.=
 
At your command all things came to be: the vast expanse of
interstellar space, galaxies, suns, the planets in their courses,
and this fragile earth, our island home.
=By your will they were created and have their being.=
 
From the primal elements you brought forth the human race,
and blessed us with memory, reason, and skill.  You made us
the rulers of creation.  But we turned against you, and betrayed
your trust; and we turned against one another.
=Have mercy, Lord, for we are sinners in your sight.=
 
Again and again, you called us to return.  Through prophets
and sages you revealed your righteous Law.  And in the
fullness of time you sent you only Son, born of a woman, to
fulfill your Law, to open for is the way of freedom and peace.
=By his blood, he reconciled us.
By his wounds, we are healed.=
 
And therefore we praise you, joining with the heavenly
chorus, with prophets, apostles, and martyrs, and with all
those in every generation who have looked to you in hope, to
proclaim with them your glory, in their unending hymn:

And so, Father, we who have been redeemed by him, and
made a new people by water and the Spirit, now bring before
you these gifts. Sanctify them by your Holy Spirit to be the
Body and Blood of Jesus Christ our Lord.
 
*At the following words concerning the bread, the Celebrant is to hold

On the night he was betrayed he took bread, said the
blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his friends, and
said, "Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you.  Do
this for the remembrance of me."
 
After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and
said, "Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new
Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the
forgiveness of sins.  Whenever you drink it, do this for the
remembrance of me."
 
Remembering now his work of redemption, and offering to you this
sacrifice of thanksgiving,
=We celebrate his death and resurrection,
as we await the day of his coming.=
 
<page 372>
 
Lord God of our Fathers: God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob; God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: Open our
eyes to see your hand at work in the world about us.  Deliver
us from the presumption of coming to this Table for solace
only, and not for strength; for pardon only, and not for
renewal.  Let the grace of this Holy Communion make us one

world in his r great High Priest, to whom, with you and the

It is truly right to glorify you, Father, and to give you thanks;

inaccessible from before time and for ever.
 
Fountain of life and source of all goodness, you made all
things and fill them with your blessing; you created them to
rejoice in the splendour of your radiance.
 
Countless throngs of angels stand before you to serve you
night and day; and, beholding the glory of your presence,
they offer you unceasing praise.  Joining with them, and
giving voice to every creature under heaven, we acclaim you,

We acclaim you, holy Lord, glorious in power.  Your mighty
works reveal your wisdom and love.  You formed us in your
own image, giving the whole world into our care, so that, in
obedience to you, our Creator, we might rule and serve all
your creatures.  When our disobedience took us far from you,
you did not abandon us to the power of death.  In your mercy
you came to our help, so that in seeking you we might find
you.  Again and again you called us into covenant with you,
and through the prophets you taught us to hope for salvation.
 
<page 374>
 
Father, you loved the world so much that in the fullness of
time you sent your only Son to be our Savior.  Incarnate by
the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, he lived as one of
us, yet without sin.  To the poor he proclaimed the good news
of salvation; to prisoners, freedom; to the sorrowful, joy.  To
fulfill your purpose he gave himself up to death; and, rising
from the grave, destroyed death, and made the whole
creation new.
 
And, that we might live no longer for ourselves, but for him
who died and rose for us, he sent the Holy Spirit, his own
first gift for those who believe, to complete his work in
the world, and to bring to fulfillment the sanctification of all.
 
*At the following words concerning the bread, the Celebrant is to hold
it, or lay a hand upon it, and at the words concerning the cup, to hold
or place a hand upon the cup and any other vessel containing wine to be

When the hour had come for him to be glorified by you, his
heavenly Father, having loved his own who were in the
world, he loved them to the end; at supper with them he took
bread, and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and
gave it to his disciples, and said, "Take, eat: This is my Body,

Father, we now celebrate this memorial of our redemption.
Recalling Christ's death and his descent among the dead,
proclaiming his resurrection and ascension to your right
hand, awaiting his coming in glory; and offering to you, from
the gifts you have given us, this bread and this cup, we praise

Grant that all who share this bread and cup may become one
body and one spirit, a living sacrifice in Christ, to the praise
of your Name.
 
Remember, Lord, your one holy catholic and apostolic
Church, redeemed by the blood of your Christ.  Reveal its

Lord, hear the prayers of =thy= people; and what we have
asked faithfully, grant that we may obtain effectually, to the
glory of =thy= Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  =Amen.=
 
 
<2>
 
Heavenly Father, you have promised to hear what we ask in
the Name of your Son: Accept and fulfill our petitions, we
pray, not as we ask in our ignorance, nor as we deserve in our
sinfulness, but as your know and love us in your Son Jesus
Christ our Lord.  =Amen.=
 
 
<3>
 
Almighty and eternal God, ruler of all things in heaven and
earth: Mercifully accept the prayers of your people, and
strengthen us to do your will; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
=Amen.=
 
 
<4>
 
Almighty God, to whom our needs are known before we ask:
Help us to ask only what accords with your will; and those
<page 395>
good things which we dare not, or in our blindness cannot
ask, grant us for the save of your Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
=Amen.=
 
 
<5>
 
O Lord our God, accept the fervent prayers of your people; in

Holy Spirit, now and for ever. =Amen.=

Lord Jesus Christ, you said to your apostles, "Peace I give

but the faith of your Church, and give to us the peace and
unity of that heavenly City, where with the Father and the
Holy Spirit you live and reign, now and for ever.  =Amen.=
 
 
<7>
 
Hasten, O Father, the coming of =thy= kingdom; and grant that
we =thy= servants, who now live by faith, may with joy behold
=thy= Son at his coming in glorious majesty; even Jesus Christ,
our only Mediator and Advocate.  =Amen.=
 
 
<8>
 
Almighty God, by your Holy Spirit you have made us one
with your saints in heaven and on earth: Grant that in our
earthly pilgrimage we may always be supported by this
fellowship of love and prayer, and know ourselves to be
surrounded by their witness to your power and mercy.  We
ask this for the sake of Jesus Christ, in whom all our
intercessions are acceptable through the Spirit, and who lives
and reigns for ever and ever.  =Amen.=

<Communion under Special Circumstances>
 
*This form is intended for use with those who for reasonable cause
cannot be present at a public celebration of the Eucharist.*
 
*When persons are unable to be present for extended periods, it is
desirable that the priest arrange to celebrate the Eucharist with them
from time to time on a regular basis, using either the Proper of the Day
or one of those appointed for Various Occasions.  If it is necessary to
shorten the service, the priest may begin the celebration at the
Offertory, but it is desirable that a passage from the Gospel first be
read.*
 
*At other times, or when desired, such persons may be communicated from
the reserved Sacrament, using the following form.*
 
*It is desirable that fellow parishoners, relatives, and friends be
present, when possible, to communicate with them.*
 
 
*The Celebrant, whether priest or deacon, reads a passage of Scripture
appropriate to the day or occasion, or else one of the following*
 
God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that
whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
=John 3:16=
 
Jesus said, "I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall
not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst."
=John 6:35=
 
<page 397>
 
Jesus said, "I am the living bread which came down from
heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and
the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my
flesh.  For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink
indeed.  Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in
me, and I in him."  =John 6:51, 55-56=
 
Jesues.  By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much
fruit, and so prove to be my disciples.  As the Father has loved
me, so have I loved you; abide in my love."  =John 15:4-5a, 8-9=
 
*After the Reading, the Celebrant may comment on it briefly.*
 
*Suitable prayers may be offered, concluding with the following or some
other Collect*
 
Almighty Father, whose dear Son, on the night before he
suffered, instituted the Sacrament of his Body and Blood:
Mercifully grant that we may receive it thankfully in
remembrance of Jesus Christ our Lord, who in these holy
mysteries gives us a pledge of eternal life; and who lives and
reigns for ever and ever.  =Amen.=
 
 
*A Confession of Sin may follow.  The following or some other form is
used*
 
Most merciful God,
we confess that we have sinned against you
in thought, word, and deed,
by what we have done,
and by what we have left undone.
We have not loved you with our whole heart;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.
<page 398>
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,
have mercy on us and forgive us;
that we may delight in your will,
and walk in your ways,
to the glory of your Name.  Amen.
 
 
*The Priest alone says*
 
Almighty God have mercy on you, forgive you all your sins
through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen you in all
goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep you in
eternal life.  =Amen.=
 
*A deacon using the preceding form substitutes "us" for "you" and "our"
for "your."*
 
 
*The Peace may then be exchanged.*
 
 
*The Lord's Prayer is said, the Celebrant first saying*
 
Let us pray in the words our Savior Christ has taught us.
 
Our Father, who art in heaven,
 hallowed be thy Name,
 thy kingdom come,
 thy will be done,
/on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
 as we forgive those
/who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
 but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom,
 and the power, and the glory,
 for ever and ever.  Amen.
 
<parallel column>
 
Our Father in heaven,
 hallowed be your Name,
 your kingdom come,
 your will be done,
/on earth as in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins
 as we forgive those
/who sin against us.
Save us from the time of trial,
 and deliver us from evil.
For the kingdom, the power,
 and the glory are yours,
 how and for ever.  Amen.
 
<page 399>
 
 
*The Celebrant may say the following Invitation*
 
The Gifts of God for the People of God
 
*and may add*    Take them in remembrance that Christ died for
you, and feed on him in your hearts by faith,
with thanksgiving.
 
 
*The Sacrament is administered with the following or other words*
 
The Body (Blood) of our Lord Jesus Christ keep you in
everlasting life.  [=Amen.=]
 
 
*One of the usual postcommunion prayers is then said, or the following*
 
Gracious Father, we give you praise and thanks for this Holy
Communion of the Body and Blood of your beloved Son
Jesus Christ, the pledge of our redemption; and we pray that
it may bring us forgiveness of our sins, strength in our
weakness, and everlasting salvation; through Jesus Christ
our Lord.  =Amen.=
 
*The service concludes with a blessing or with a dismissal*
 
Let us bless the Lord.
=Thanks be to God.=

Jesus Christ our Lord.*
 
*The Prayer continues with these words*
 
And so, Father, we bring you these gifts.  Sanctify them by

*At the following words concerning the bread, the Celebrant is to hold
it, or to lay a hand upon it; and at the words concerning the cup, to
hold or place a hand upon the cup and any other vessel containing wine
to be consecrated.*
 
On the night he was betrayed he took bread, said the
blessing, and gave it to his friends, and
said, "Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you.
Do this for the remembrance of me."
 
After supper, he took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and
said, "Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new
Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the
forgiveness of sins.  Whenever you drink it, do this for the
remembrance of me."
 
Father, we now celebrate the memorial of your Son.  By
means of this holy bread and cup, we show forth the sacrifice
of his death, and proclaims his resurrection, until he comes
again.
 
Gather us by this Holy Communion into one body in your
Son Jesus Christ.  Make us a living sacrifice of praise.
 
By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy
Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and
for ever.  AMEN.

<Page 405>
 
*At the following words concerning the bread, the Celebrant is to hold
it, or to lay a hand upon it; and at the words concerning the cup, to
hold or place a hand upon the cup and any other vessel containing wine
to be consecrated.*
 
On the night he was handed over to suffering and death, our
Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks
to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said,
"Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you.  Do this
for the remembrance of me."
 
After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given
thanks, he gave it to them, and said, "Drink this, all of you:
This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you
and for many for the forgiveness of sins.  Whenever you drink
it, do this for the remembrance of me."
 
Recalling now his suffering and death, and celebrating his
resurrection and ascension, we await his coming in glory.
 
Accept, O Lord, our sacrifice of praise, this memorial of our
redemption.
 
Send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts.  Let them be for us
the Body and Blood of your Son.  And grant that we who eat
this bread and drink this cup may be filled with your life and
goodness.
 
*The Celebrant then prays that all may receive the benefits of Christ's
work, and the renewal of the Holy Spirit.*
 
*The Prayer concludes with these or similar words*
 
All this we ask through your Son Jesus Christ.  By him, and
with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor
and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.  AMEN.
 
<page 406>
 
 
*Additional Directions*
 
*The Holy Table is spread with a clean white cloth during the
celebration.*
 
*When the Great Litany is sung or said immediately before the Eucharist,
the Litany concludes with the Kyries, and the Eucharist begins with the
Salutation and the Collect of the Day.  The Prayers of the People
following the Creed may be omitted.*
 
*When a psalm is used, it may be concluded with Gloria Patri.  In Rite
One services, the following form of the Gloria may be used:*
 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,
 and to the Holy Ghost:
 
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
 world without end.  Amen.
 
*The Kyrie eleison (or "Lord, have mercy") may be sung or said in
threefold, sixfold, or ninefold form.  The Trisagion, "Holy God", may be
sung or said three times, or antiphonally.*
 
*Gloria in excelsis, or the hymn used in place of it, is sung or said
from Christmas Day through the Feast of the Epiphany; on Sundays from
Easter Day through the Day of Pentecost, on all the days of Easter Week,
and on Ascension Day; and at other times as desired; but it is not used
on the Sundays or ordinary weekdays of Advent or Lent.*
 
*It is desirable that the Lessons be read from a lectern or pulpit, and
that the Gospel be read from the same lectern, or from the pulpit, or
from the midst of the congregation.  It is desirable that the Lessons
and the Gospel be read from a book or books of appropriate size and
dignity.*
 
*When a portion of the congregation is composed of persons whose native
tongue is other than English, a reader appointed by the celebrant may
read the Gospel in the language of the people, either in place of, or in
addition to, the Gospel in English.*
 
*If there is no Communion, all that is appointed through the Prayers of
the People may be said.  (If it is desired to include a Confession of
Sin, the
<page 407>
service begins with the Penitential Order.)  A hymn or anthem may then
be sung, and the offerings of the people received.  The service may then
conclude with the Lord's Prayer; and with either the Grace or a
blessing, or with the exchange of the Peace.*
 
*In the absence of a priest, all that is described above, except for the
blessing, may be said by a deacon, or, if there is no deacon, by a lay
reader.*
 
*The greetnge of the Peace may take place at the time of the
administration of the Sacrament (before or after the sentence of
Invitation).*
 
*Necessary announcements may be made before the service, after the
Creed, before the Offertory, or at the end of the service, as
convenient.*
 
*It is the function of a deacon to make ready the Table for the
celebration, preparing and placing upon it the bread and wine.  It is
customary to add a little water to the wine.  The deacon may be assisted
by other ministers.*
 
*During the Great Thanksgiving, it is appropriate that there be only one
chalice on the Altar, and, if need be, a flagon of wine from which
additional chalices may be filled after the Breaking of the Bread.*
 
*The following anthem may be used at the Breaking of the Bread:*
 
Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world:
 have mercy on us.
 
Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world:
 have mercy on us.
 
Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world:
 grant us peace.
 
*While the people are coming forward to receive Communion, the celebrant
receives the Sacrament in both kinds.  The bishops, priests, and deacons
at the Holy Table then communicate, and after them the
people.*
 
*Opportunity is always to be given to every communicant to receive the
consecrated Bread and Wine separately.  But the Sacrament may be*
<page 408>
received in both kinds simultaneously, in a manner approved by the
bishop.*
 
*When the celebrant is assisted by a deacon or another priest, it is
customary for the celebrant to administer the consecrated Bread and the
assistant the Chalice.  When several deacons or priests are present,
some may administer the Bread and others the Wine.  In the absence of
sufficient deacons and priests, lay persons licensed by the bishop
according to the canon may administer the Chalice.*
 
*If the consecrated Bread or Wine does not suffice for the number of
communicants, the celebrant is to return to the Holy Table, and
consecrate more of either or both, by saying*
 
Hear us, O heavenly Father, and with thy (your) Word and
Holy Spirit bless and sanctify this bread (wine) that it, also,
may be the Sacrament of the precious Body (Blood) of thy
(your) Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who took bread (the cup)
and said, "This is my Body (Blood)."  =Amen.=
 
*or else the celebrant may consecrate more of both kinds, saying again
the words of the Eucharistic Prayer, beginning with the words which
follow the Sanctus, and ending with the Invocation (in the case of
Eucharistic Prayer C, ending with the narrative of the Institution).*
 
*When the service of a priest cannot be obtained, the bishop may, at
discretion, authorize a deacon to distribute Holy Communion to the
congregation from the reserved Sacrament in the following manner:
 
  1.  After the Liturgy of the Word (and the receiving of the people's
offering), the deacon reverently places the consecrated Sacrament on the
Altar, during which time a communion hymn may be sung.
 
  2.  The Lord's Prayer is then said, the deacon first saying, "Let us
pray in the words our Savior Christ hath (has) taught us."
 
  3.  And then, omitting the breaking of the Bread, the deacon proceeds
with what follows in the liturgy as far as the end of the postcommunion
prayer, and then dismisses the people.*
 
*If any of the consecrated Bread or Wine remain, apart from any which
may be required for the Communion of the sick, or of others who for
<page 409>
weighty cause could not be present at the celebration, or for the
administration of Communion by a deacon to a congregation when no priest
is available, the celebrant or deacon, and other communicants,
reverently eat and drink it, either after the Communion of the people or
after the Dismissal.*
 
*A hymn may be sung before or after the postcommunion prayer.*
 
 
*Disciplinary Rubrics*
 
*If the priest knows that a person who is living a notoriously evil life
intends to come to Communion, the priest shall nd amendment of life.*
 
*The priest shall follow the same procedure with those who have done
wrong to their neighbors and are a scandal to the other members of the
congregation, not allowing such persons to receive Communion until they
have made restitution for the wrong they have done, or have at least
promised to do so.*
 
*When the priest sees that there is hatred between members of the
congregation, =he= shall speak privately to them, telling them that they
may not receive Communion until they have forgiven each other. And if
the person or persons on one side truly forgive the others and desire
and promise to make up for their faults, but those on the other side
refuse to forgive, the priest shall allow those who are penitent to come
to Communion, but not those who are stubborn.*
 
*In all such cases, the priest is required to notify the bishop, within
fourteen days at the most, giving the reasons for refusing Communion.*
