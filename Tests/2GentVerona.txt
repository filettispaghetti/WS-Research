Marry, by these special marks: first, you have 
learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms, 
like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a 
robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had 
the pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had 
lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had 
buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes 
diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to 
speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were 
wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you 
walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you 
fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you 
looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you 
are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look 
on you, I can hardly think you my master.
