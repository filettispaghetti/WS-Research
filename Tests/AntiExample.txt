First, Iâ€™d like to thank my husband,
Dan. Without him this book would not
exist. Thank you also to my wonderful
family and friends, who believed in this
idea before anyone else. And thank you
to everyone who has taken the time to
tell me what Good and Cheap means to
them. I heard from thousands of people
throughout the course of creating and
distributing this book.
