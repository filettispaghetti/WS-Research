The source text for these PDF files was a true facsimile
(probably the only one ever made) of the 1549 BCP privately
printed in 1896. This book appears in David Griffiths'
Bibliography of the Book of Common Prayer as 1896/5, and is a
facsimile of the very first printing of the Book of Common
Prayer, Griffiths 1549/1. The links on the image of the Table of
Contents below lead to these PDF files. We have a page of
technical notes for these PDF files at
http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1549/PDF_Notes.htm, if
you are interested.
The fonts used were JSL Blackletter, and Founder's Caslon, from
HW Caslon & Co. These were chosen for their similarity to the
original text, and the fact that they contained all the required
ligatures and other special characters.
