of people p°eƒente bee ƒo great that they cannot conueniently ¥and at
the Churche doo°e: then let them ¥and within the Churche in
ƒome conuenient place, nygh vnto the Churche doo°e;
And there all thynges be ƒayed and done,
appoynted to be ƒayed and done
 at the Churche doo°e. 
OF THEM THAT BE Baptiƒed in p°iuate houƒes in tyme
of nece±itie.
¶ The pa¥ours amd curates ƒhall oft admonyƒhe the people,
that they differ not the Baptiƒme of infantes any longer then
the Sondaye, o° other holy daye, nexte after the chylde bee
bo°ne, onle±e vpon a great & reaƒonable cauƒe declared to the
curate and by hym app°oued.
And alƒo they ƒhal warne them that without great cauƒe, and
nece±itie, they Baptize not child°en at home in they° houƒes.
And when great nede ƒhall compell them ƒo to doe, that then they
mini¥er it on this faƒhion.
Fir¥ let them that be p°eƒent cal vpon God fo° his grace, and
ƒaye the Lo°des p°ayer, yf the tyme will ƒuffre. And then one
of them ƒhal name the childe, and dippe him in the water, o°
poure water vpon him, ƒaying theƒe woo°des.
¶ N. I Baptiƒe the in the name of the father, and of the
ƒonne, and of the holy gho¥e. Amen.
¶ And let them not doubt, but that the childe ƒo Baptiƒed, is
lawfully and ƒufficiently Baptized, and ought not to be
Baptized againe, in the Churche. But yet neuerthele±e if the
childe whiche is after this ƒo°te Baptized, doe afterwarde lyue:
it is expedient that he be b°ought into the Churche, to thentent
the p°ie¥e maye examine and trye, whether the childe be
lawfully Baptized o° no. And yf thoƒe that b°yng any childe to
the Churche doe aunƒwere that he is alreadye Baptized: Then
ƒhall the p°ie¥ examin them, further.
By whom the childe was Baptiƒed?
Who was p°eƒente when the childe was baptiƒed?
Whether they called vpon God fo° grace and ƒuccoure in
that nece±itie?
With what thyng, o° what matter they dyd Baptiƒe the
childe?
With what woo°des the childe was Baptiƒed?
Whether they thinke the childe to be lawfully and perfectly
Baptiƒed?
And if the mini¥ers ƒhall p°oue by the aunƒwers of ƒuche as
b°ought the childe, that all thynges were done, as they ought to
be: Then ƒhall not he ch°i¥en the childe agayne, but ƒhall
receyue hym, as one of the flocke of the true ch°i¥ian people,
ƒaying thus. 
P°iuate Baptiƒme
Certifie you, that in this caƒe ye haue doen
wel, and acco°ding vnto due o°d°e concerning
the baptiƒing of this child, which being bo°ne
