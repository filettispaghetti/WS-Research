The 1559 Book of Common Prayer,
The PDF text is taken from an original edition published by
Robert Barker in 1634; it is intended to appear as much like the
original as possible. This particular edition is listed in David
Griffith's Bibliography of the Book of Common Prayer as 1634/1,
and appears to be similar to editions published by Barker
throughout the 1630's. The basic PDF text comes from the older
HTML text already on the site, adjusted to agree with the 1634
copy in spelling, punctuation, etc.
The woodcuts and other decorations all come from this particular
book, although they weren't necessarily used in the places you
see them in the PDF text. This is because, due to the book's
binding, it was not possible to scan in woodcuts and other
decorations on the pages on the right-hand side.
The fonts used were JSL Blackletter, and Founder's Caslon, from
HW Caslon & Co. These were chosen for their similarity to the
original text, and the fact that they contained all the required
ligatures and other special characters.

AT the beginning both of Morning prayer, and likewiſe of Euening

Sentences of the Scriptures that follow. And then he all ſay that,

T what time soeuer a sinner doth
repent him of hi# sinne from the bottome
of hi# heart; I will put all hi#
wickednesse out of my remembrance
saith the Lord.
Ezek. 18.
I do know mine own wickednesse,
and my sinne i# alway against me.
Pſal. 51.
Turne thy face away from our
sinne#, O Lord and blot out all our
offence#.

humble and contrite haert#.
Rent your heart#, and not your garment#, and turne to the
Lord your God, because he i# gentle and mercifull, hee i#
patient and of much mercie, and such a one that i# sorry for
your affliction#.
Joel 2.
To thee, O Lord God belongeth mercie# and forgeuenesse,
for we haue gone away from thee, and haue not hearkened to
thy voice, whereby we might walke in thy Lawe#, which thou
hast appointed for v#.
Daniel 9.
Correct v#, O Lord, and yet in thy iudgement, not in thy

Jere. 10
Matth. 3. Amend your liue#, for the kingdome of God i# at hand.

1 John 1. If we say that we haue no sinne, we deceiue ourselue#, and

Erely beloued brethren, the Scripture moueth
v# in sundry place#, to acknowledge
and confesse our manifold sin# and wickednesse,
and that we should not dissemble nor
cloke them before the face of Almighty God
our heauuenly Father, but confesse them
with an humble, lowly, penitent & obedient
heart to the end that we may obtaine forgiuene# of the same by
hi# infinite goodnesse and mercie. And although we ought at
all time# humbly to acknowledge our sinne# before God, yet
ought we most chiefly so to doe, when we assemble and meet
together, to render thanke# for the great benefit# that wee
haue receiued at hi# hand#, to set foorth hi# most worthy
praise, to heare hi# most holy word, and to aske those thing#
which be requisite & necessary, aswel for the body a# the soule.
Wherfore I pray and beseech you, a# many a# be here present,
to accompany me with a pure heart and humble voyce, vnto the
throne of the heauenly grace, saying after me.
¶ A generall confeon, to be ſaid of the whole Congregation
after the Minier, kneeling.
Lmighty and most mercifull Father, we haue
erred and strayed from thy waye#, like lost
sheepe we haue followed too much the deuice#
and desire# of our owne heart#. We
haue offended against thy holy Lawe#: We
haue left vndone those thing# which we
ought to haue done, and we haue done those
thing# which wee ought not to haue done, and there i# no
health in v#: but thou, O Lord, haue mercy vpon v# miserable 
offender#. Spare thou them O God, which confesse their
fault#, restore thou them that bee penitent, according to thy
promise# declared vnto mankinde, in Christ Jesu our Lord:
and grant, O most mercifull Father, for hi# sake, that we may
hereafter liue a godly, rightuou#, and sober life, to the glory of
thy holy Name. Amen.
¶ The abſolution or remion of ſinnes to be pronounced
by the Minier alone.
Lmighty God, the father of our Lord Jesu#
Christ, which desireth not the death of a sinner,
but rather that he may turne from hi# wickednesse
and lieu, and hath giuen power and commandement
to hi# Minister#, to declare and
pronounce to hi# people being penitent, the
absolution and remission of their sinne#: hee pardoneth and
absolueth all them which truly repent, and vnfainedly beleeue
hi# holy Gospel. Wherefore we beseech him to grant v# true
repentaunce and hi# holy Spirit, that those thing# may please
him, which we doe at thi# present, and that the rest of our life
hereafter may be pure and holy so that at the last we may come
to hi# eternall ioye, through Jesu# Christ our lord.
The people shall aunswere.
Amen. 
¶ Then all the Minier hegin the Lords prayer
with a loud voice.
Ur Father, which art in heauen, hallowed be thy
name. Thy Kingdome come. Thy will be done in
earth a# it i# in heauen. Giue v# thi# day our daily
bread. And forgiue v# our trespasse#, a# we forgiue
them that trespasse against v#. And lead v# not into temptation.
But deliuer v# from euill.
¶ Then likewiſe he all ſay.
O Lord, open thou our lip#.
Aunſwere.
And our mouth shall shew forth thy praise.
Priee.
O God, make speed to saue v#.
Aunſwere.
Lord, make haste to helpe v#.

Come let v# syng vnto the Lord: let v# heartily
reioyce in the strength of our saluacion.
Let v# come before hi# presence with
thanksgiuing: and shew our selfe# glad in him
with Psalme#.
For the Lord i# a great God: and a great
King aboue all god# :
In hi# hand are all the corner# of the earth: and the
strength of the hill# i# hi# also.
The sea i# hi#, and he made it: and hi# hand# prepared the
drie land. 
 O come, let v# worship and fall downe: and kneele before
the Lord our maker.
 For he i# the Lord our God : and we are the people of hi#
pasture, and the sheepe of hi# hand#.
 To day if ye will heare hi# voice, harden not your heart# :
a# in the prouocacion, and a# in the day of temptation in the
wildernesse.
 When your father# tempted me : prooued me, and saw my
worke#.
 Fourty yeere# long wa# I grieued with thi# generation,
and said : it i# a people that doe erre in their heart# : for they
haue not knowen my waye#.
 Unto whom I sware in my wrath : that the should not enter
into my rest.
 Glory be to the father, and to the Sonne : and to the holy

shall be ſung or ſaid immediately after Benedius, this Confeon of our

Hosoeuer wyll be saued : before

Which Faith, except euery one

The Father incomprehensible, the Sonne incomprehensible :
and the holy Ghost incomprehensible.
The Father eternall, the Sonne eternall : and the holy
Ghost eternall.
And yet they are not three eternal# : but one eternall.
A# also there be not three incomprehensible#, nor three
vncreated : but one vncreated, and one incomprehensible.
So likewise the Father i# Almightie, the Sonne Almighty :
and the holy Ghoste Almighty.
And yet they are not three Almightie# : but one Almighty.
So the Father i# God, the Sonne i# God : and the holy
Ghost i# God.
And yet they are not three God# : but one God. 
So lykewise the Father i# Lord, the Sonne Lord : and the
holy Ghost Lord.
And yet not three Lord# : but one Lord.
For like a# we be compelled by the Christian veritie : to acknowledge
euery person by himselfe to be God and Lord.
So are we forbidden by the Catholique Religion : to say
there be three God#, or three Lord#.
The Father i# made of none : neither created, nor begotten.
The Sonne i# of the Father alone : not made, nor created,
but begotten.
The holy Ghost i# of the Father, and of the Sonne: neither
made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.
So there i# one Father, not three Father#, one Sonne, not
three Sonne# : one holy Ghost, not three holy Ghost#.
And in thi# Trinitie, none i# afore, or after other : none i#
greater or lesse then another.
But the whole three person# bee coeternall together : and
coequall.
So that in all thing#, a# i# aforesaid : the Unitie in Trinitie,
and the Trinitie in Unitie i# to be worshipped.
He therefore that will bee saued: must thu# thinke of the
Trinitie.
Furthermore it i# necessary to euerlasting saluation : that he
also beleeue rightly in the incarnation of our Lord Jesu Christ.
For the right Faith i#, that we beleeue & confesse : that our
Lord Jesu# Christe the Sonne of God, i# God and man.
God of the substaunce of the Father, begotten before the
world# : and man of the substauce of hi# mother, borne in the
world.
Perfect god, and perfect man : of a reasonable soule, and
humane flesh subsisting.
Equall to the father a# touching hi# Godhead : and inferior
to the Father, touching hi# manhood.
Who although he be God and man : yet he i# not two, but
one Christ.
One; not by conuersion of the Godhead into flesh : but by
taking of the manhood into God;
One altogether, not by confusion of substaunce : but by vnity
of person. 
For a# the reasonable soule and flesh i# but one man : so
God and man i# but one Christ.
Who suffered for our saluation : descended into hell, rose
againe the third day from the dead.
He ascended into heauen: he sitteth on the right hand of the
Father, God Almighty : from whence he shall come to iudge
the quicke and the dead.
At whose comming all men shall rise againe with their bodie#
: and shall geue account for their owne work#.
And they that haue done good, shall go into life euerlasting
: and they that haue done euill, into euerlastyng fire.
Thi# i# the Catholique faith : whiche except a man beleeue
faithfully, he cannot be saued.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne : and to the holy
Ghost.
A# it wa# in the beginning, i# now, and euer shall be :
world without end. Amen.
Thus endeth the order of Morning and Euening prayer
throughout the whole yeere.

Lord God, which hast wounded v# for our
sinne#, and consumed v# for our transgression#,
by thy late heauy and dreadful visitation, and
now in the midst of iudgement remembering
mercie, hast redeemed our soul# from the iawe#
of death : Wee offer vnto thy Fatherly goodnesse our selue#,
our soul# and bodie#, which thou hast deliuered, to be a liuing
sacrifice vnto thee, allwaye# praising and magnifying thy
mercie# in the midst of thy Church, through Jesu# Christ our

Or this.

and health into our dwelling# : We offer vnto thy diuine Maiesty
the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiuing, lauding and magnifying
thy gloriou# Name for such thy preseruation and prouidence
ouer v#; through Jesu# Christ our Lord. Amen.

Lords Supper, or holy Communion O many as intend to be partakers of the holy Communion, all

¶ Then all the Church-wardens, or ſome other by them appoynted,
gather the deuotion of the people, and put the ſame into the poore mans

Prie al ſaie.
¶ Let v# pray for the whole state of Christ# Church militant
herein earth.
Imighty and euerliuing God, which by thy holy
Apostle hast taught v# to make prayer# and
supplication#, & to giue thank# for all men:
Wee humbly beseech thee moste mercifully (to
accept our almes and) to receiue these our prayer#
which we offer vnto thy Diuine Maiestie, beseeching thee to
inspire continually, the vniuersall Church with the spirit of
trueth, vnitie, and concord: and grant that all they that doe
confesse thy holy Name, may agree in the trueth of thy holy
word, and liue in vnitie and godly loue. We beseech thee also
to saue and defend all Christian King#, Prince#, and Gouernour#,
and specially thy seruaunt, Charles our King that vnder
him we may be godly and quietly gouerned: and graunt vnto
hi# whole Counsaile, and to all that be put in authoritie vnder
him, that they may truely and indifferently minister Justice, to
the punishement of wyckednesse and vice, and to the maintenance
of God# true Religion and vertue. Giue grace (O heauenly
Father) to all Bishop#, Pastour#, and Curate#, that
they may both by their life and doctrine set foorth thy true &
liuely word, and rightly and duely administer thy holy Sacrament#:
and to all thy people giue thy heauenly grace, and
specially to thi# Congregation hear present, that with meeke
If ther be no

then all
the words (of
accepting our
almes) be left

heart and due reuerence, they may heare & receiue thy holy
word, truely seruyng the in holinesse and rightuousne# all the
daie# of their life. And we most humbly beseech thee of thy
goodnesse, O Lord, to comfort & succour all them which in
thi# transitory life be in trouble, sorrow, neede, sicknesse, or
any other aduersitie: grant thi#, O Father, for Jesu# Christ#
sake our onely Mediatour and Aduocate. Amen.
¶ Then all follow this exhortation, at certaine times when the Curate all
ſee the people negligent to come to the holy Communion.
E be come together at thi# time, dearely beloued
brethren to feede at the Lord# Supper, vnto the
which in God# behalfe I bid you all that be heere
present, & beseech you for the Lord Jesu# Christ#
sake, that ye will not refuse to come thereto, being so louingly
called, and bidden of God himselfe. Yee know how greuou#
and vnkinde a thing it i#, when a man hath prepared a rich
feast: decked hi# table with all kinde of prouisyon, so that there
lacketh nothing but the guest# to sit down, and yet they which
be called (without any cause) most vnthankfully refuse to come.
Which of you in such a case would not be moued? Who would
not think a great iniurie and wrong done vnto him? Wherefore
moste derely beloued in Christ take yee good heed, lest yee,
wythdrawyng your selue# from thi# holy Supper, and prouoke
God# indignation against you, it i# an easie matter for a man
to say, I will not communicate, because I am otherwise letted
with worldly busynesse, but such excuse# be not so easily accepted
and allowed before God. If any man say, I am a greuou#
sinner, and therefore am afraid to come: wherefore then doe ye
not repent and amend: When God calleth you, bee you not
ashamed to say you wil not come? When you should returne to
God, will you excuse your selue# and say that you be not
ready? consider ernestly with your selue# how little such fained
excuse# shall auaile before God. They that refused the feast in
the Gospel, because they had bought a Farme, or would try
their yoke# of Oxen, or because they were married, were not
so excused, but counted vnworthy of the heuenly feast. I for my
part am here present and according to mine office, I bid you in 
the name of God, I call you in Christ# behalfe, I exhort you,
a# you loue your owne saluation, that ye will bee partaker# of
thi# holy Communion. And a# the Son of God, did vouchsafe
to yeeld vp hi# soule by death vpon the Crosse for your health:
Euen so it i# your dutie to receiue the Communion together in
the remembraunce of hi# death a# he himselfe commanded.
Now, if you wyll in no wise thu# doe, consider with your
selue#, how great iniury you doe vnto God, and howe sore
punishment hangeth ouer your head# for the same. And wherea#
you offend God so sore in refusing thi# holy banket, I
admonish, exhort, and beseech you, that vnto thi# vnkindnesse
yee will not adde any more. Which thing yee shall doe if yee
stand by a# gazer# and looker# of them that do communicate,
and be no partaker# of the same your selue#. For what thing
can thi# be accounted else, then a further contempt and
vnkindenesse vnto God? Truely it i# a greate vnthankefulnesse
to say nay when ye be called, but the fault i# much greater,
when men stand by, and yet will neither eate nor drinke thi#
holy Communion with other. I pray you what can thi# be else,
but euen to haue the mysterie# of Christ in derision? It i# said
vnto all: Take yee and eate, take and drinke ye all of thi#.
Doe thi# in remebraunce of me. With what face then, or with
what countenaunce shall ye heare these word#? what will thi#
be else, but a neglecting, a despising, and mocking of the
Testament of Christ? Wherfore rather then yee should so doe,
depart you hence, and giue place to them that bee godly dysposed.
But when you depart, I beseech you ponder with your
selue#, from whom ye depart. Ye depart from the Lord#
Table: ye depart from your brethren, and from the banket of
most heauenly food. These thing# if ye earnestly consider ye
shall by God# grace, returne to a better mynde, for the obtaining
wherof, we shall make our humble petition# while we
shal receiue the holy Communion.
¶ And ſometime all this be ſaid alſo at the diſcretion
of the Curate.
Earely beloued, forasmuche a# our duety i# to rendre
to almighty God our heauenly father most
hearty thanke# for that he hath giuen hi# Sonne
our Sauiour Jesu# Christ not onely to die for v#,
but also to be our spiritual food, and sustenaunce, a# it i#
declared vnto v#, a# well by God# word a# by the holy Sacrament
of hi# blessed body and blood, the which being so
comfortable a thing to them which receiue it worthily and so
daungerou# to them that will presume to receiue it vnworthely:
my duty i# to exhort you to consider the dignitie of the
holy mystery, and the great peril of the vnworthy receiuing
therof, and so to search and examine your owne conscience#, a#
you shold come holy and cleane to a most godly and heuenly
Feast, so that in no wise you come but in the mariage garment,
required of God in holy Scripture, and so come and be receiued
a# worthy partaker# of such an heauenly Table, The
way and meane# therto i#: First to examine your liue# and
conuersation by the rule of God# Commandement# and whereinsoeuer
yee shall perceiue your selue# to haue offended either
by will, word, or deed, there bewaile your owne sinfull liue#,
and confesse your selue# to Almighty God, with full purpose of
amendement of life. And if yee shall perceiue your offence# to
bee such, a# be not onely against God, but also against your
neighbour#, then you shall reconcyle your selue# vnto them,
ready to make restitution and satisfaction according to the
vttermost of your power# for all iniurie# and wrong# done by
you to any other, and likewise being ready to forgiue other that
haue offended you a# you would haue forgiuene# of your
offence# at God# hand: for otherwyse the receiuing of the holy
Communion doth nothing el#e, but encrease your damnation.
And because it i# requisite that no man should come to the holy
Communion, but with a full trust in God# mercy, and with a
quiet conscience: therfore if there be any of you, which by the
meane# aforesaid cannot quiet hi# owne conscience, but
requireth further comfort or counsell, then let him come to mee,
or some other discreet and learned minister of God# word, and 
open hi# griefe, that hee may receiue suche ghostly counsell,
aduice, and comfort, a# hi# conscience may bee relieued, and
that by the ministery of God# word, he may receiue comfort,
and the benefite of absolution, to the quieting of hi# conscience,
and auoyding of all scruple and doubtfulnesse.
¶ Then all the Prie ſay this exhortation.
Earely beloued in the Lord, yee that minde to come
to the holy Communion of the Body and Blood of
oure Sauiour Christ, must consider what S. Paul
writeth to the Corinthian#, how hee exhorteth all
person# diligently to trie and examine themselue#, before they
presume to eate of that Bread, and drinke of that Cup. For a#
the benefit i# great, if with a true penitent heart and liuely
faith, wee receiue that holy Sacrament (for then wee spiritually
eate the flesh of Christ, and drinke hi# blood, then wee
dwell in Christ and Christ in v#, wee be one wyth Christ, and
Christ with v#:) so i# the danger great, if we receiyue the same
vnworthily. For then wee bee guilty of the Body and Blood of
Christ our Sauiour: wee eate and drinke our owne
damnation, not considering the Lord# Body: wee kindle God#
wrath against v#, wee prouoke him to plague v# with diuer#
disease#, and sundry kinde# of death. Therefore if any of you
be a blasphemer of God, an hinderer, or slaunderer of hi#
word, an adulterer, or bee in malice or enuie, or in any other
greuou# crime, bewaile your sinne#, and come not to thi# holy
Table, lest after the taking of that holy Sacrament, the deuill
enter into you, a# he entred into Juda#, and fill you full of all
iniquitie#, and bring you to destruction both of bodye and
soule. Judge therefore your selue# (brethren) that yee be not
iudged of the Lord. Repent you truly for your sinne# past:
haue a liuely and stedfast faith in Christ our Sauiour. Amend
your liue#, and be in perfect charitie wyth all men, so shal yee
be meete partaker# of those holy mysterie#. And aboue all
thinge# yee must giue most humble and hearty thank# to God
the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, for the redemption
of the world, by the death and Passion of our Sauiour Christ,
both God and man, who did humble himselfe, euen to the
death vpon the Crosse, for v# miserable sinner# which lay in 
darckenesse, and shadow of death, that hee might make v# the
children of God, and exalt v# to euerlasting life. And to the
end that we should alway remember the exceeding great loue
of our Master and onely Sauiour Jesu# Christ, thu# diyng for
v#, and the innumerable benefit# which by hi# preciou# bloodsheading
he hath obtained to v#, hee hath instituted and
ordained holy mysterie#: a# pledge# of hi# loue, and continuall
remembrance of hi# death, to our great and endlesse comfort.
To him therfore with the Father and the holy Ghost, let v#
giue (a# we are moste bounden) continuall thanke#, submitting
our selue# wholly to hi# holy will and pleasure, and studying to
serue him in true holinesse and righteousnesse, all the daye# of
our life. Amen.
¶Then all the Prie ſay to them that come to receiue the holy
Communion.
Ou that doe truely and ernestly repent you of
your sinne#, and bee in loue and charity with
your neighbour# and intend to lead a new life,
following the Commandement# of God, and
walking from hencefoorth in hi# holy waye#:
Draw neere, and take thi# holy Sacrament to
your comfort make your humble confession to Almighty God,
before thi# Congregation here gathered together in hi# holy
Name, meekely kneling vpon your knee#.
¶ Then all this generall confeon be made, in the name of all those that
are minded to receiue the holy Communion, either by one of them, or
elſe by one of the Miniers, or by the Prie himſelfe, all kneeling
humbly vpon their knees.
Lmighty God, Father of our Lord Jesu#
Christ, maker of all thing#, Judge of all
men, wee knowledge and bewaile oure
manifold sinne# and wickednesse, which we
from time to time most greuously haue committed,
by thought word and deed, against
thy diuine Maiestie, prouoking most iustly
thy wrath and indignation against v#: Wee doe earnestly
repent, and be heartily sorry for these our misdoing#, the 
remembrance of them i# greuou# vnto v#: the burthen of theim
i# intolerable. Haue mercy vpon v#, haue mercy vpon v#, most
mercifull Father, for thy Sonne our Lord Jesu# Christ# sake,
forgiue v# all that i# past, and grant that wee may euer
hereafter serue and please thee, in newenesse of life, to the
honour and glory of thy name through Jesu# Christ our Lord.
Amen.
¶ Then all the Prie or the Biop (being preſent) ande vp, and turning
himſelfe to the people, ſay thus.
Lmighty God, our heauenly father, who of hi#
great mercy hath promised forgeuenesse of sinne#,
to all them, which with hearty repentance and true
faith turn to him : haue mercy vpon you, pardon
and deliuer you from all your sinne#, confirme and
strengthen you in all goodnesse, and bring you to euerlastyng
life; through Jesu# Christ our Lord. Amen.
¶ Then all the Prie alſo ſay,
¶ Heare what comfortable word# our Sauiour Christ
saith to all them that truely turne to him.
Come vnto me all that trauaile and be heauy laden, and I
will refresh you. So God loued the world that he gaue hi#
onely begotten Sonne, to the end that all that beleeue in him,
should not perish, but haue life euerlasting.
¶ Heare also what S. Paul saith.
Thi# i# a true saying, and worthy of all men to be receyued,
that Jesu# Christ came into the world to saue synner#.
¶ Heare also what S. John saith.
If any man sinne, we haue an aduocate with the Father,
Jesu# Christ the righteou#, and he i# the propitiation for our
sinne#.
¶ After which the Prie all proceed ſaying.
Lift vp your heart#.
Aunſwere.
We lift them vp vnto the Lord. Prie:.
Let v# giue thanke# vnto our Lord God.
Aunſwere.
It i# meet and right so to doe. 
Prie.
It i# very meet, right, and our bounden duetie that wee
should at all time#, and in all place#, geue thanke# to thee, O
Lord holy Father, Almighty euerlasting God. ¶ Here all follow the proper Preface, according to the time, if there be
any ſpecially appointed, or else immediatly all follow:
Therfore with Angelle# and Archangel#, &c.
¶ Proper Prefaces.
¶ Vpon Christmas day and ſeuen days after.
Ecause thou dyddest giue Jesu# Christ, thyne onely
Sonne, to bee borne a# thi# day for v#, who by the
operation of the holy Ghost wa# made very man of
the substaunce of the Uirgin Mary hi# mother, and
that without spot of sinne, to make v# cleane from all sinne.
Therefore with Angel# and Archangel#, &c.
¶ Vpon Eaer daye, and ſeuen days after.
Ut chiefly are we bound to praise thee for the gloriou#
resurrection of thy Sonne Jesu# Christ our
Lord, for he i# the very Paschall Lambe, which
wa# offered for v#, and hath taken away the sin of
the world, who by hi# death hath destroyed death,
and by hi# rising to life againe, bath restored to v# euerlasting
life. Therefore with Angel#, &c.
¶ Vpon the Aſcention day, and ſeuen days after.
Hrough thy most dearely beloued Sonne, Jesu#
Christ our Lord, who after hi# most gloriou# resurrection,
manifestly appeared to all hi# Apostle#,
and in their sight ascended vp into heauen,
to prepare a place for v#, that where he i#,
thither might we also ascend, and reigne with him in glory.
Therfore with Angel# and Archangel#, &c.
¶ Vpon Wytſonday, and ſixe days after.
Hrough Jesu# Christ our Lord, according to
whose most true promise, the holy Ghost came
down thi# day from heauen, with a sodden great
sound, a# it had beene a mighty winde, in the likenesse
of fiery tonge# lighting vpon the Apostle#, to 
teach them, and to leade them to all trueth, giuing them both
the gift of diuer# language#, and also boldnesse with feruent
zeale, constantly to preach the Gospel vnto all nation#, whereby
wee are brought out of darcknesse and errour into the cleare
light and true knowledge of thee, and of thy Sonne Jesu#
Christ. Therefore with Angel#, &c.
¶ Vpon the fea of Trinitie onely.
T i# very meete right, and our bounden duetie,
that we should at all time#, and in all place#,
giue thanke# to thee, O Lord, Almighty and
euerlasting God, which art one God, one Lord,
not one onely person, but three person# in one
substaunce, for that which we beleeue of the glory of the
Father, the same we beleeue of the Sonne, and of the holy
Ghost, without any difference or inequalitie. Therefore, &c.
¶ After which Prefaces, all follow immediatly.
Herefore with Angel# and Archangel#, and with
all the company of heauen, we laud and magnify
thy gloriou# Name, euermore praising thee, and
saying: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of host#,
heauen and earth are ful of thy glory, Glory be
to the, O Lord most hyghe.
¶ Then all the Prie kneelinge downe at Gods borad, ſay in the name of
all them that all receiue the Communion, this prayer following.
E do not presume to come to thi# thy table (O
merciful Lorde) trusting in our owne rightuousnesse,
but in thy manifolde and great mercie#.
We be not worthy so much a# to gather vp
the crumbe# vnder thy Table, But thou art the
same Lord, whose property i# allwaye# to haue mercy: grant
v# therefore graciou# Lord, so to eate the flesh of thy deare
Sonne Jesu# Christ, and to drinke hi# blood, that our sinfull
bodie# may be made cleane by hi# body, and our soule#
washed through hi# most preciou# blood, and that we may
euermore dwell in him, and he in v#. Amen. 
¶ Then the Prie anding vp, all ſay as foloweth:
Lmighty God our heauenly Father which of thy
tender mercie, didst giue thine onely Sonne Jesu#
Christ, to suffer death vpon the Crosse for our
redemption, who made ther (by hi# one oblation of
himself once offered) a full, perfect and sufficient sacrifice,
oblation, and satisfaction for the sin# of the whole world, and
did institute, and in hi# holy Gospel command v# to continue a
perpetuall memory of that hi# preciou# death, vntill hi#
comming againe: Heare v# O merciful Father, we beseech the,
and grant that wee receiuyng these thy creature# of Bread and
Wine, according to thy Sonne our Sauiour Jesus Christ# holy
Institution, in remembrauce of hi# death and passion, may bee
partaker# of hi# most blessed Body and Blood, who in the
same night that hee wa# betraied, tooke bread, and when he
had giuen thanke#, he brake it, and gaue it to hi# Disciple#,
saying: Take, eate, thi# i# my Body, which i# giuen for you,
doe thi# in remembrance of me. Likewise after supper he tooke
the Cup, and when hee had giuen thanke#, he gaue it to them,
saying: Drinke ye all of thi#, for thi# i# my Blood of the New
Testament, which i# shed for you and for many, for the remission
of sinne#: doe thi# a# oft a# yee shall drinke it in remembrance
of mee.
¶ Then all the Minier fire receiue the Communion in both kindes him-
ſelfe, and next deliuer it to other Miniers (if any bee there preſent), that
they may helpe the chiefe Minier and after to the people in their hands
kneeling. And when he deliuereth the Bread, he shall ſay.
He Body of our Lord Jesu# Christ, which wa# giuen
for thee, preserue thy body and soule into euerlasting
life: and take and eate thi# in remembrance that
Christ died for thee, and feede on him in thine heart by faith
with thankesgiuing. 
¶ And the Minier that deliuereth the Cup, all ſay.
He Blood of our Lord Jesu# Christ, which wa# shed
for thee, preserue thy body and soule into euerlasting
life: and drinke thi# in remembrance that Christ#
blood wa# shed for thee, and be thankefull.
¶ Then all the Prie ſay the Lords prayer, the people repeating after him
euery petition. After all be ſaid as followeth.
Lorde and heauenly Father, we thy humble seruant#,
entirely desire thy Fatherly goodnesse,
mercifully to accept thi# our Sacrifice of praise
and thankesgeuing moste humblye beseeching thee

bee a reasonable, holy, and liuely sacrifice vnto thee, humbly
beseeching thee, that all wee which be partaker# of thi# holy
Communion, may be fulfilled with thy grace and heauely benediction.
And although wee be vnworthy, through our manifold
sinne#, to offer vnto the any sacrifice: yet wee beseech thee to
accept thi# our bounden duety and seruice, not weighing our
merit#, but pardoning our offence#, through Jesu# Christ our
Lord, by whom and with whom, in the vnity of the holy Ghost,
all honour and glory be vnto thee, O Father Almighty, world

Or this.
Lmighty and euerlasting God, we moste heartely

¶ Then all be ſaid or ſung.
Lory be to God on high. And in earth peace,

wee giue thank# to thee, for thy great glorie. O
Lord God, heauenly King, God the Father
Almightie. O Lord the onely begotten Sonne Jesu Christ. O
Lord God, Lambe of God, Sonne of the Father, that takest

takest away the sinne# of the world, haue mercy vpon v#.
Thou that takest away the sinne# of the world, receiue our
praier. Thou that sittest at the right hand of God the Father,
haue mercie vpon v#. For thou onely art holy: thou only art
the Lord, thou onely O Christ with the holy Ghost, art most
high in the glory of God the father. Amen.
¶ Then the Prie or the Biop, if he be preſent, all let them depart with
this bleing.
He peace of God, which passeth all vnderstanding,

Ssist v# mercifully, O Lord, in these our supplication#
and prayer#, and dispose the way of thy seruant#
toward the attainment of euerlasting saluation,
that emong all the change#, and chance# of thi# mortall life,
they may euer be defended by thy moste graciou#, and ready

ALmighty Lord and euerliuyng God, vouchsafe we

our heart#, and bodie# in the waye# of thy Lawe#,
and in the worke# of thy Commandement#, that

Rant wee beseech thee Almighty God, that the

Pon the Holy dayes (if there bee no Communion,) all
be ſaid all that is appointed at the Communion, vntill
the end of the Homily, concluding with the generall
prayer, (for the whole estate of Christ# Church
militant here in earth) and one or moe of these
Colles before rehearſed, as occaſion all ſerue.
¶ And there albe no celebration of the Lords
Supper, except there be a good number to Communicate with the Prie,
according to his diſcretion.
¶ And If there be not aboue twenty perſons in the pari of diſcretion to
receiue the Communion, yet there all be no communion except foure or
thre at the lea communicate with the Prie.
¶ And in Cathedrall and Collegiate Churches, where be many Pries and
Deacons, they all all receiue the Communion with the Minier euery
Sunday at the lea, except they haue a reaſonable cauſe to the contrary.
¶ And to take away the ſuperition, which any perſon hath, or might
haue in the Bread and Wine, it all ſuffice that the Bread be ſuch as is vſuall
to be eaten at the Table, with other meates, but the be and pure Wheat 
bread, that conueniently may be gotten. And If any of the Bread and Wine
remaine, the Curate shall haue it to his owne vſe.
¶ The Bread and Wine for the Communion all bee prouided by the
Curate, and the Churchwardens at the charges of the Pari, and the Pari
all be diſcharged of ſuche ſummes of money, or other dueties, which
hitherto they haue paid far the ſame by order of their houſes euery Sunday.
¶ And note that euery Pariioner all communicate, at the lea three
times in the yere, of which Eaer to be one: and all alſo receiue the
Sacramentes, and other Rites, according to the order in this booke appointed.
And yerely at Eaer, euery Pariioner all reckon with his Parſon,
Vicar or Curate, or his, or their deputie or deputies, and pay
to them or him, all Eccleſiaicall dueties,
accuomably due, then and at that
time to be paid. * *
* 
 The Miniration of Baptiſme,
to bee vſed in the Church.
T appeareth by auncient Writers, that the
Sacrament of Baptiſme in the old time, was not
commonly minired, but at two times in the
yeere, at Eaer and Whitſontide. At which
times it was openly minired in the preſence of
al the congregation. Which cuome now being
growne out of vse, (although it can not for
many conſiderations bee well restored agayne) it
is thought good to follow the same as nere as
conueniently may be. Wherefore the people are
to bee admonished, that it is mo conuenient that Baptiſme ould not be
adminired but vpon Sundayes, and other Holy-dayes, when the mo
number of people may come together, as well for that the Congregation
there preſent may teifie the receiuing of them that be newly baptized, into
the number of Chris Church, as alſo becauſe in the Baptiſme of Infants,
euery man preſent may be put in remembrance of his owne profeion made
to God in his Baptiſme. For which cause alſo, it is expedient that Baptiſme
be minired in the Engli tongue. Neuerthelee (if neceity ſo require)
children may at all times be baptized at home.
When there are children to he baptized vpon the Sunday, or Holy-day,
the Parents al giue knowledge ouer night, or in the Morning, afore the
beginning of Morning prayer, to the Curate. And then the Godfathers,
Godmothers, and people, with the children mu be ready at the font, either
immediately after the la Leon at Morning Prayer, or elſe immediately
after the la Leon at Euening prayer, as the Curate by his diſcretion all
appoint. And then andinge there, the Prie ſhall aske whether the children
bee baptized or no. If they aunſwere, No: Then all the Prie ſay thus.
 
Earely beloued, forasmuche a# all
men be conceiued and borne in sin,
and that our Sauiour Christ saith,
None can enter into the kingdome of
God, except hee bee regenerate, and
borne anew of water and of the Holy
Gost: I beseech you to call vpon God
the Father, through our lord Jesu#
Christ, that of hi# bounteou# mercie,
hee will grant to these children, that
thing which by nature they cannot haue, that they may be
baptized with water and the holy Ghost, and receiued into
Christ# holy Church, and be made liuely member# of the same.
Then ſhall the Prie ſay.
¶ Let v# praye.
Lmightie and euerlasting GOD, whiche of thy
great mercie diddest saue Noe and hi# familie in
the Arcke, from perishing by water, and also diddest
safely lead the children of Israel, thy people,
throrow the Red Sea, figuring therby thy holy
Baptisme: and by the Baptisme of thy welbeloued Son Jesu#
Christ, diddest sanctifie the flood Jordan, and all other water#,
to the mysticall washing away of sinne: We beseech thee for
thine infinite mercie#, that thou wilt mercifully look vpon these
children, sanctifie them and wash them with thy holy Gost, that
they being deliuered from thy wrath, may bee receiued into the
Arcke of Christ# Church, and being stedfast in faith, ioyfull
through hope, and rooted in charitie, may so passe the waue#
of thi# troublesome world, that finally they may come to the
land of euerlasting life, there to reigne with thee world without
end, through Jesu# Christ our Lorde. Amen.
Lmighty and immortall God, the aide of all that
neede, the helper of all that flee to thee for succour,
the life of them that beleeue, and the resurrection
of the dead: wee call vpon thee for these
Infant#, that they comming to thy holy Baptisme,
may receiue remission of their sinne# by spirituall regeneracion.
Receiue them (O Lord) a# thou hast promised by thy 
welbeloued Sonne, saying: Aske and you shall haue; seeke,
and you shall finde: knocke and it shall bee opened vnto you:
So giue now vnto v# that aske. Let v# that seeke, finde open
the gate vnto v# that knocke, that these Infante# may enioy the
euerlasting benediction of thy heauenly washing, and may come
to the eternall Kingdome which thou hast promised by Christ
our Lord. Amen.
¶ Then all the Prie ſaye
Heare the word# of the Gospel, written by S. Marke,
in the tenth Chapter.
T a certaine time they brought children to Christ
that hee should touch them, and hi# Disciple# rebuked
those that brought them. But when Jesu#
saw it, he wa# displeased, and said vnto them.
Suffer little children to come vnto me, and forbid
them not, for to such belongeth the Kyngdome of God. Verily,
I say vnto you; whosoeuer doeth not receiue the Kingdome of
God a# a liytle child, hee shall not enter therein. And when
hee had taken the vp in hi# arme#, hee put hi# hande# vpon
them, and blessed them.
Mar.10.13
¶ After the Goſpel is read, the Minier al make this briefe exhortation
vpon the words of the Goſpel.
Riend#, ye heare in thi# Gospel the word# of our
Sauiour Christ, that he commaunded the children
to be brought vnto him: how he blamed those that
woulde haue kepte them from him: how he
exhorted all men to follow their innocencie. You
perceiue how by hi# outward gesture and deede he declared hi#
good will toward them: for he embraced them in hi# arme#, he
laied hi# hand# vpon them, and blessed them, Doubt yee not
therfore, but ernestly beleeue that he will likewise fauourably
receiue these present Infant#, that hee will embrace them with
the arme# of hi# mercie, that hee will giue vnto them the
blessing of eternal life: and make them partaker# of hi# euerlasting
Kingdome. Wherfore we being thu# perswaded of the
good will of our heauenly father, towarde# these Infant#
declared by hi# Sonne Jesu# Christ, and nothing doubting, 
but that hee fauourably alloweth thi# charitable worke of our#,
in bringing these children to hi# holye Baptisme: let v# faithfully
and deuoutly giue thanke# vnto him, and say,
Lmighty and euerlasting God, heauenly Father,
we giue thee humble thank#, that thou hast vouchsaufed
to call v# to the knowledge of thy grace
and faith in thee: Increase thi# knowledge, and
confirme thi# faith in v# euermore: Giue thy holy
Spirit to these infant#, that they may be borne againe, and be
made heire# of euerlasting Saluacion, through our Lord Jesu#
Christ, who liueth and reigneth with thee and the holy Spirit,
now and for euer. Amen.
¶ Then the Prie al ſpeake vnto the Godfathers and Godmothers, on this
wyſe:
Elbeloued friend#, yee haue brought these children
here to bee baptized, ye haue prayed that our Lord
Jesu# Christ, would vouchsafe to receiue them, to
lay hi# hand# vpon them, to blesse them, to release
them of their sinne#, to giue them the Kingdome of heauen,
and euerlasting life. Yee haue heard also that our Lord Jesu#
Christ hath promised in hi# Gospel, to grant all these thing#
that ye haue prayed for: which promise he for hi# part will
most surely keepe and performe. Wherfore after thi# promise
made by Christ, these infant# must also faithfully for their part
promise by you that be their suretie#, that they will forsake the
deuill and all his worke#, and constantly beleeue God# holy
word, and obediently keepe hi# Commandement#.
¶ Then al the Prie demand of the Godfathers and Godmothers these
queions following.
Doest thou forsake the deuill and all hi# worke#, the vaine
pompe and glory of the world, with all couetou# desire# of the
same, and the carnall desire# of the flesh, so that thou wilt not
follow, nor be led by them?
Aunſwere.
I forsake them all.
The Minister.
Doest thou beleeue in God the father almighty, maker of
heauen and earth? And in Jesu# Christ hi# onely begotten 
Sonne our Lord? And that hee wa# conceiued by the holy
Ghost, borne of the Virgin Mary, that he suffered vnder
Pontiu# Pilate, wa# crucifyed, dead and buried, that hee went
downe into hell, and also did rise againe the third day, that he
ascended into heauen, and sitteth at the right hand of God the
Father Almighty; and from thence shall come againe at the end
of the world, to iudge the quicke and the dead? And doest thou
beleeue in the holy Ghost the holy Catholicque Church, the
Communion of Sainct#, the remission of synne#, the resurreccion
of the fleshe, and euerlasting life after death?
Aunſwere.
All thi# I stedfastly beleeue.
Minier.
Wylt thou be baptized in thi# faith?
Aunſwere.
That is my desyre.
¶ Then all the Prie ſay.
Mercifull God, grant that the old Adam in these
children may be so buried, that the new man may
be raised vp in them. Amen.
Grant that all carnall affeccion# may die in
them, and that all thing# belonging to the spirit,
may liue and grow in them. Amen.
Grant that they may haue power and strength to haue victory,
and to triumph against the deuill, the world, and the
flesh. Amen.
Grant that whosoeuer is here dedicated to thee, by our office
and ministery, may also be endued with heauenly vertue#, and
euerlastingly rewarded, through thy mercy, O blessed Lord
God, who doest liue and gouerne all thing#, world without
ende. Amen.
Lmighty euerliuing God, whose most derely beloued
Sonne Jesu# Christe, for the forgiuenesse
of our sinne#, did shed out hi# moste preciou# side
both water and blood, and gaue commaundement
to hi# Disciple# that they should go teach all
Nation#, and baptize them in the Name of the Father, the
Sonne, and of the holy Ghost : Regard, wee beseech thee, the
supplication# of thy Congregation, and grant that all thy ser-
uant# which shall bee baptized in thi# water, may receiue the
fulnesse of thy grace, and euer remaine in the number of thy
faithfull and elect children, through Jesu# Christ our Lord.
Amen.
¶ Then the Prie al take the childe in his hands, and aſke the name; and
naming the childe, all dip it in the water, ſo it bee diſcreetly and warily
done, ſaying,
N. I baptize the in the Name of the Father, and of the
Sonne, and of the holy Ghost. Amen.
¶ And if the childe bee weake, it all ſuffice to powre water vpon it, ſaying
the foreſaid words.
N. I baptize the in the Name of the Father, and of the
Sonne, and of the holy Ghost. Amen.
¶ Then the Prie all make a Croe vpon the Childes forehead, ſaying:
E receiue thi# Childe into the Congregation of
Christ# flocke, and doe signe him with the signe of
the Crosse, in token that hereafter hee shal not bee
ashamed to confesse the Faith of Christ crucified,
and manfully to fight vnder hi# banner against
sinne, the world, and the deuill, and to continue Christ#
faithfull souldier and seruaunt vnto hi# liue# end. Amen.
Then all the Prie ſay,
Eeing now, dearely beloued brethren that these
children bee regenerate and grafted into the body
of Christ# Congregacion, let v# giue thank# vnto
God for these benefit#, and with one accord make
our prayer# vnto Almighty God, that they may
leade the rest of their life according to thi# beginning.
Then al be ſayd.
Our Father which art in heauen, &c.
Then al the Prie ſay,
Ee yelde thee hearty thanke# most mercifull Father,
that it hath pleased thee to regenerate thi#
Infant with thy holy Spirite, to receiue him for
thine owne childe by adoption, and to incorporate
him into thy holy Congregacion. And humbly we 
beseche thee to grant that he being dead vnto sinne, and lyuing
vnto righteousnesse, and being buried with Christ in hi# death,
may crucify the old man, and vtterly abolishe the whole body of
sinne, that a# he i# made partaker of the death of thy Son, so
hee may bee partaker of hi# resurrection, so that finally with
the residue of thy holy Congregacion, he may bee inheritour of
thine euerlasting Kingdome. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
¶ At the la end, the Prie calling the Godfathers and Godmothers
together, al say this exhortation following.
Orasmuch a# these children haue promised by you
to forsake the deuill and his worke#, to beleeue in
God, and to serue him, you must remember that it
i# your part# and dutie# to see that these Infant#
be taughte, so soone as they shall be able to learne,
what a solemne vow, promise, and profession they haue made
by you. And that they may know these thing# the better; yee
shall call vpon them to heare Sermon#, and chiefly you shall
prouide that they may learne the Creed, the Lord# prayer, and
the ten Commandement# in the English tongue; and all other
thing# which a Christian man ought to know and beleeue to
hi# soule# health, and that these children may bee vertuously
brought vp, to leade a godly and a Christian life, remembring
alwaye# that Baptisme doeth represent vnto v# our profession,
which i#, to follow the example of our Sauiour Christ, and to
be made like vnto him, that a# he died and rose againe for v#:
so should we whiche are baptized, die from sinne, and rise
again vnto righteousnesse, continually mortifiyng all our euill
and corrupt affection#, and dayly proceding in all vertue and
godlynesse of liuing.
¶ The Minier al command that the children bee brought to the Byop
to be confyrmed of him, ſo ſoone as they can ſay in their vulgar tongue, the Articles of the Faith, the Lords prayer, and the ten Commandementes,
and be further inrued in the Catechiſme ſet foorth for that
purpoſe, accordingly as it is there expreed. 
Of them that are to be baptized in priuate houſes in
time of necety, by the Minier of the Pari, or any other lawfull Minier that can be procured.
He Paors and Curates all oft admoni the people, that they
deferre not the Baptiſme of Infants any longer then the Sunday, or
other Holy day, next after the Childe be borne vnlee vpon a
great and reaſonable cauſe declared to the Curate, and by him
approoued.
¶ And alſo they all warne them, that without great cauſe, and necety,
they procure not their children to bee baptized at home in their
houſes. And when great neede all compel them ſo to do, that then Baptiſme
shall be adminiered in this faion.
¶ Fir, let the lawfull Minier, and them that be preſent, call vpon God
for his grace, and ſay the Lords Prayer, if the time will ſuffer. And then the
childe being named by ſome one that is preſent, the ſaid lawfull Minier
all dip it in water, or poure water vpon it, ſaying theſe words:
N. I Baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and of the
Sonne, and of the holy Ghost. Amen.
¶ And let them not doubt, but that the childe ſo baptized, is lawfully
and ſufficiently baptized, and ought not to bee baptized againe. But yet
neuerthelee, if the childe which is after this ſort baptized, doe afterward
liue, it is expediente that it be broughte into the Church, to the Intent that
if the Prie or Minier of the ſame Pari did himſelf baptize that childe,
the Congregation may be certified of the true forme of Baptisme by him
priuately before vſed: or if the child were baptized by any other lawfull
Minier, that then the Minier of the Pari where the childe was borne or
Chriened, all examine and trie, whether this childe be lawfully baptized,
or no. In which caſe, if thoſe that bring any childe to the Church, do anſwer
that the ſame child is already baptized, then all the Minier examine
them further, ſaying,
By whom wa# the childe baptized?
Who wa# present when the childe wa# baptized?
And because something# essentiall to thi# Sacrament may
happen to bee omitted through feare or haste in such time# of
extremitie; therefore I demand further of you;
With what matter wa# the childe baptized?
With what word# wa# the childe baptized?
Whether think you the childe to bee lawfully and perfectly
baptized? 
¶ And if the Minier all finde by the anſwers of ſuch as bring the childe,
that all things were done as they ought to bee: then hal not hee
Chrien the childe againe, but all receiue him as one of the flocke of
the true Chriian people, ſaying thus,
Certifie you, that in thi# case all i# well done, and according
vnto due order concerning the baptizing of
thi# childe, which being borne in originall sinne and
in the wrath of God, i# nowe by the lauer of regeneration
in Baptisme, receiued into the number of the children of
God, and heire# of euerlasting life: for our Lord Jesu# Christ
doeth not deny hi# grace and mercy vnto such ‘Infant#, but
most louingly doth call the vnto him: a# the holy gospel doth
witnesse to our comfort on thi# wise.
T a certaine time they brought children vnto Christ
that he should touch them: and hi# Disciple# rebuked
those that brought them. But when Jesu# saw it, he
wa# displeased, and said vnto them: Suffer little
children to come vnto me, and forbid them not, for to such belongeth
the Kingdome of God. Verely I say vnto you, whosoeuer
doth not receiue the Kingdome of God a# a little childe,
hee shall not enter therin. And when he had taken them vp in
his arme#, he put hi# hand# vpon them, and blessed them.
Marke 10.
¶ After the Goſpel is read, the minier al make this exhortation vpon the
words of the Goſpel.
Riend#, you heare in thi# Gospel the word# of our
Sauiour Christe, that he commanded the chyldren
to be brought vnto him: how he blamed those that
would haue kepte them from him, how hee exhorted
all men to follow their innocencie: Yee
perceiue how by hi# outward gesture and deed he declared hi#
good will toward them. For he embraced them in hi# arme#,
he laid hi# hand# vpon them, and blessed them, Doubt ye not
therefore, but earnestly beleeue, that he hath likewise fauourably
receiued thi# present Infant, that hee hath embraced him
with the arme# of hi# mercie, that he hath giuen vnto him the
blessing of eternall life, and made him partaker of hi# euerlasting
Kingdome. Wherfore wee beeing thu# perswaded of the
good will of our heauenly Father, declared by hi# Sonne
Jesu# Christ toward# thi# Infant, Let v# faithfully and de-
voutly giue thanke# vnto him, and say the prayer, which the
Lord himselfe taught, and in declaration of our Faith, let v#
recite the Article# contained in our Creed.
¶ Here the Minier with the Godfathers, and Godmothers all ſay.
 ¶ Our Father which art in heauen, &c.
¶ Then all the Prie demand the name of the childe, which being by the
Godfathers and Godmothers pronounced, the Minier all ſay,
 Doest thou in the name of thi# childe forsfake the deuill and
all hi# worke#, the vaine pompe and glory of the world, with
all the couetous# desire# of the same, the carnall desire# of the
flesh, and not to follow and be led by them?
Anſwere.
 I forsake them all.
Minier.
 Doest thou in the name of thi# childe professe thi# faith, to
beleeue in God the Father Almighty, maker of heauen and
earth? And in Jesu# Christ hi# onely begotten Sonne our
Lord? and that hee wa# conceiued by the holy Ghost, borne of
the Uirgin Mary, that hee suffered vnder Pontiu# Pilate, wa#
crucified, dead, and buried, that he wet downe into hell, and
also did rise againe the third daye, that hee ascended into heauen,
and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty,
and from thence he shall come againe at the end of the world,
to iudge the quicke and the dead? And doe you in hi# name
beleeue in the holy Ghost the holy Catholicque Church, the
Communion of Saint#, the Remission of sinne#, Resurreccion,
and euerlasting life after death?
Aunſwere.
 All thi# I steadfastly beleeue. 
¶ Let v# pray.
Lmighty and euerlasting God,
heauenly father, wee giue thee
humble thancke#, for that thou
hast vouchsafed to call v# to the
knowledge of thy grace and faith
in thee: Increase thi# knowledge,
and confirme thi# faith in v# euermore:
Giue thy holy Spirit to thi#
infant,that he being borne againe
and being made heire of euerlastinge
saluacion, through our Lord
Jesu# Christ, may continue thy seruant, and attaine thy
promise, through the same our Lord Jesu# Christ thy Sonne,
who liueth and reigneth with thee in the vnity of the same holy
Spirit euerlastingly. Amen.
¶ Then al the Minier make this exhortatcion, to the Godfathers and
Godmothers.
Orasmuch a# thi# childe hath promised
by you to forsake the deuill and al hi#
worke#, to beleeue in God, and to serue
him: you must remember that it i# your
part and duety, to see that thi# Infant
be taught, so soone a# hee shall bee able
to learne what a solemne vow, promise,
and profession hee hath made by you.
And that hee may know these thinge#
the better, yee shall call vpon him to
heare Sermon#, and chiefly you shall prouide that hee may
learne the Creed, the Lord# prayer and the ten Commandement#
in the English tongue, and all other thing# which a
Christian man ought to know, and beleeue to hi# soule# health,
and that thi# childe may bee vertuously brought vp, to leade a
godly and a christian life, remembring alway that Baptisme
doth represent vnto v# our profession, which i#, to follow the
example of our Sauiour Christ, and be made like vnto him,
that a# hee died and rose againe for v#, so shoulde wee which
are baptized, die from sinne, and rise againe vnto righteous-
nesse, continually mortifying all our euill and corrupt affection#,
and daily proceding in all vertue, and godlinesse of
liuing.
And so foorth, a# in publique Baptisme.
¶ But if they which bring the Infants to the Church, doe make ſuch
vncertaine aunſwers to the Pries queons, as that It cannot appeare that
the Childe was baptized with water, In the Name of the Father, and of
the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost : whichh are the eentiall parts of
Baptiſme: then let the Prie baptize It in form aboue written, concerning
publique Baptisme, ſaying that at the dipping of the Childe in the Font,
he all vſe this forme of wordes.
F thou be not already baptized, N. I baptize thee in
the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the
holy Ghost. Amen. 
The order of Confirmation, or laying
on of hands vpon children baptized, and able
to render an account of their Faith, according
to the Catechiſme following.

O the end that confirmacion may bee minired to
the more edifying of ſuch, as all receiue it (according
vnto S. Pauls dorine, who teacheth that all
things should bee done in the Church, to the edification
of the ſame) it is thought good that none
hereafter all bee confirmed but ſuch as can ſay in
their mother tongue the Articles of the Faith, the
Lords prayer, and the ten Commandements, and
can alſo anſwere to ſuch queions of this ort
Catechiſme, as the Biop (or ſuche as hee al appoint) all by his
diſcretion appoſe them in. And this order is mo conuenient to be obſerued
for diuers conſiderations.
Fir, becauſe that when children come to the yeeres of diſcretion, and
haue learned what their Godfathers and Godmothers promiſed for them in
Baptiſme, they may then themſelues with their owne mouth, and with their
own conſent, openly before the Church, ratifie and confirme the ſame : and
alſo promiſe that by the grace of God, they will euermore endeauour
themſelues faithfully to obſerue and keepe ſuch things, as they by their owne
mouth and confeon haue aented vnto.
Secondly, forasmuche as Confirmation is minired to them that be
Baptized, that by impoſition of hands and prayer, they may receiue rength
and defence again all temptations to ſinne, and the aaults of the world and
the deuill: it is mo mete to be minired when children come to that age, that partly by the frailty of their owne fle, partly by the aaults of the
world and the deuill, they begin to bee in danger to fall into ſundry kindes of
nne.
Thirdly, for that it is agreeable with the vſage of the Church in times
pa, whereby it was ordained that Confirmation ould be minired to
them that were of perfe age, that they being instrued in Christs Religion, 
ould openly profee their owne faith, and promiſe to bee obedient vnto the
will of God.
And that no man all thinke that any detriment all come to children
by deferring of their Confirmation, hee all know for trueth, that it is
certaine by Gods word, that children being baptized, haue all things
neceary for their ſaluation, and be vndoubtedly ſaued.
 A Catechisme, that is to ſay, an In-
ruction to bee learned of euery Childe,
before hee bee brought to bee Confirmed
by the Biop.

daughter, thy man seruant, and thy maid seruant, thy cattell,
and the stranger that is within thy gate#: for in six daye# the
Lord made heauen and earth, the sea, and all that in them i#,

seuenth day, and hallowed it.

¶ The forme of ſolemnization
of Matrimony
Ir, the banes mu be asked three ſeuerall Sundayes or Holy
dayes, in the time of Seruice, the people being preſent after the accuomed
maner.
And If the perſons that would be married dwell in diuers Paries, the
Banes mu be asked in both Paries and the Curate of the one Pari all
not ſolemnize Matrimony betwixt them, without a certificate of the Banes
being thrise asked, from the Curate of the other Pari.
At the day appoynted for ſolemnization of Matrimony, the perſons to
bee married all come into the body of the Church, with their friends and
neighbours. And there the Prie all ſay thus.
Earely beloued friend#, wee are gathered
together here in the sight of God, and in the
face of hi# Congregation, to ioyne together
thi# man and thi# woman in holy Matrimony,
which i# an honorable state, instituted
of God in Paradise, in the time of Man#
innocencie, signifying vnto v# the mysticall
vnion that i# betwixt Christ and hi# Church : which holy estate
Christe adorned and beautified with hi# presence and first miracle
that he wrought in Cana of Galilee, and i# commended of
S. Paul to be honourable among all men, and therfore i# not
to be enterprised, nor taken in hand vnaduisedly, lightly or
wantonly, to satisfie men# carnall lust# and appetite#, like
brute beast# that haue no vnderstanding, but reuerently, discreetly,
aduisedly, soberly, and in the feare of God, duely
considering the cause# for the which Matrimony wa# ordained.
One wa# the procreation of children, to be brought vp in the
feare and nurture of the Lord, and praise of God. Secondly, it
wa# ordained for a remedie against sinne and to auoid fornication,
that such person# a# haue not the gift of continency 
might marry, and keepe themselue# vndefiled member# of
Christ# body. Thirdly, for the mutuall societie, helpe, and comfort,
that the one ought to haue of the other, both in prosperity
and aduersitie, into the which holy estate these two person# present,
come now to be ioyned. Therefore if any man can shew
any iust cause, why they may not lawfully be ioyned together
let him now speake, or el#e hereafter for euer hold hi# peace.
And alſo ſpeaking vnto the perſons that all be
 married, he all ſay.
Require and charge you (a# you will answere
at the dreadful day of Judgement, when the
secret# of all heart# shall be disclosed) that if
either of you doe know any impediment, why
ye may not be lawfully ioyned together in
Matrimony, that ye confesse it. For be ye well
assured, that so many a# be coupled together, otherwise then
Godd# word doeth allow, are not ioyned together by God,
neither i# their Matrimony lawfull.
¶ At which day of mariage, if any man doe alledge and declare any impediment,
why they may not be coupled together in Matrimony by Gods
Law, or the Lawes of this Realme, and will be bound, and ſufficient
ſureties with him to the parties, or elſe put in a caution to the full value of
ſuch charges as the perſons to be married doe ſuaine, to prooue his allegation:
then the ſolemnization mu bee deferred vnto ſuch time as the
truth be tried. If no impediment be alleadged, then all the Curate ſay
vnto the man,
N. Ilt thou haue thi# woman to thy wedded wife, to
liue together after God# ordinance, in the holy
estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou loue her, comfort
her, honour, and keepe her, in sickenesse, and in health? and
forsakyng all other, keepe thee onely vnto her, so long a# you
both shall liue?
The man shall anſwere,
I will.
Then all the Prie ſay vnto the woman,
N. Ilt thou haue thi# man to thy wedded husband, to
liue together after God# ordinance in the holy
estate of Matrimonie? Wilt thou obey him and 
serue him, loue, honour, and keepe him, in sicknesse and in
health? and forsaking all other, keepe thee onely vnto him so
long a# you both shall liue?
The woman all anſwere,
I will.
Then all the Minier ſay,
Who giueth thi# woman to be married to thi# man?
¶ And the Minier receiuing the woman at her fathers or friendes hands,
all cauſe the man to take the woman by the right hand, and ſo either to
giue their troth to other, the man fir ſaying.
I N. take thee N. to my wedded wife, to haue and to hold
from thi# day forward, for better for worse, for richer for
poorer, in sickenesse and in health, to loue and to cherish, till
death v# depart, according to God# holy ordinance, and therto
I plight thee my troth.
¶ Then all they looſe their hands, and the woman taking againe the man
by the right hand, all ſay.
I N. take thee N. to my wedded husband, to haue and to
hold from thi# day forward, for better for worse, for richer for
poorer, in sickenesse and in health, to loue, cherish, and to
obey, till death v# depart, according to God# holy ordinance,
and thereto I giue thee my troth.
¶ Then all they againe looſe their hands, and the man all giue vnto the
woman a Ring, laying the ſame vpon the booke, with the accuomed
duety to the Prie and Clerke. And the Prie taking the Ring, all
deliuer it vnto the man, to put it vpon the fourth finger of the womans
left hand. And the man taught by the Prie, all ſay.
With this Ring I thee wed, with my body I thee worship, and
with all my worldly good#, I thee endow: In the Name of
the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost. Amen.
¶ Then the man leauing the Ring vpon the fourth finger of the womans left
hand, the Minier all ſay,
Eternall God, creatour and preseruer of all mankind,
giuer of all spirituall grace, the authour of
euerlasting life, send thy blessing vpon these thy
seruaunt#, thi# man and thi# woman, whom wee
blesse in thy Name, that a# Isaac and Rebecca
liued faithfully together, so these person# may surely performe
and keepe the vow and couenant betwixt them made (wherof
this Ring giuen, and receiued, i# a token and pledge) and may
euer remain in perfect loue and peace together, and liue 
according vnto thy Law#, thorough Jesu# Christ our Lord.
Amen.
¶ Then all the Prie ioyne their right hands together and ſay.
Those whom God hath ioyned together, let no man put
asunder.
¶ Then all the Minier ſpeak vnto the people.
Orasmuch a# N. and N. haue consented together in
holy wedlocke, and haue witnessed the same before
God, and thi# company, and therto haue giuen and
pledged their troth either to other, and haue declared
the same by geuing and receiuing of a Ring, and by
ioyning of hand#: I pronounce that they be man and wife
together. In the Name of the Father, of the Sonne and of the
holy Ghost. Amen.
¶ And the Minier all adde this bleng.
OD the Father, God the Sonne, God the holy
Ghost, blesse, preserue, and keepe you, the Lord
mercifully with hi# fauour looke vpon you, and so
fill you with all spirituall benediction and grace,
that you may so liue together in thi# life, that in the world to
come you may haue life euerlasting. Amen.
¶ Then the Minier or Clerckes going to the Lords Table, all ſay, or ſing

thy holy word they shall profitably learne, they
may indeed fulfill the same. Looke, O Lord
mercifully vpon them from heauen, and blesse them. And a#
thou diddest send thy blessing vpon Abraham and Sarah, to
their great comfort : so vouchsafe to send thy blessing vpon

¶ This prayer next following al be omitted, where the woman is pa

Mercifull Lord, and heauenly Father, by whose
gracious# gift mankind i# increased, wee beseech
thee assist with thy blessing these two person#, that
they may both bee fruitfull in procreation of children,
also liue together so long in godly loue and
honestie, that they may see their children# children, vnto the
third and fourth generation vnto thy praise and honour:
through Jesu# Christ our Lord. Amen.
God which by thy mightie power hast made all
thing# of naught, which also (after other thing#
set in order) didst appoint that out of man (created
after thine owne image and similitude) woman
should take her beginning : and knitting 
them together, diddest teach that it should neuer be lawfull to
put asunder those, whom thou by Matrimony hadst made one :
O God which haste consecrated the state of Matrimony to such
an excellent Mystery, that in it i# signified and represented the
spirituall mariage and vnitie betwixt Chnist and hi# Church :
Looke mercifully vpon these thy seruant#, that both thi# man
may loue hi# wife, according to thy word (a# Christe did loue
hi# spouse the Church, who gaue himselfe for it, louing and
cherishing it, euen a# hi# owne flesh) and also that thi# woman
may be louing and amiable to her husband a# Rachel, wise a#
Rebecca, faithfull and obedient a# Sara, and in all quietnesse,
sobrietie, and peace, be a folower of holy and godly matron#.
O Lord, blesse them both, and grant them to inherite thy
euerlasting Kingdome, through Jesu# Christ our Lord. Amen.
¶ Then all the Prie ſay,
Lmighty God, which, at the beginnyng did
create our first parent# Adam and Eue, and did

powre vpon you the riche# of hi# grace, sanctifie,
& blesse you, that ye may please him both in
body and soule, and liue together in holy loue,
vnto your liue# end. Amen.
¶ Then al begin the Communion. And after the Goſpel all be ſaid a
Sermon, wherein ordinarily (ſo oft as there is any mariage) the office of a
man and wife all be declared, according to holy Scripture, or if there be
no Sermon, the Minier all reade this that followeth.
Ll yee which be married, on which intend to take
the holy estate of Matrimony vpon you, heare
what holy Scripture doth say, a# touching the
duety of husband# toward# their wiue#, and
wiue# toward# their husband#.
Saint Paul in hi# Epistle to the Ephesian# the fifth Chapter,
doth giue thi# commandement to all married men, Yee
husband# loue your wiue#, euen a# Christ loued the Church,
and hath giuen himselfe for it, to sanctifie it, purging it in the
fountaine of water, through the word, that he might make it
vnto himselfe a glorious# Congregation, not hauing spot or
wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should bee holy and
blamelesse. So men are bound to loue their owne wiue#, a# 
their owne bodie#. Hee that loueth hi# owne wife loueth himselfe.
For neuer did any man hate hi# owne flesh, but nourisheth
and cherisheth it, euen a# the Lond doth the Congregation,
for we are member# of hi# body, of hi# flesh and of hi#
bone#. For thi# cause shall a man leaue father and mother,
and shall be ioyned vnto hi# wife, and they two shall be one
flesh. Thi# misterie i# great : but I speake of Christ and of the
Congregation. Neuerthelesse, let euery one of you so loue hi#
owne wife, euen a# himselfe.
Likewise the same Saint Paul writing to the Collossian#,
speaketh thu# to all men that be married. Ye men, loue your
wyue#, and be not bitter vnto them.
Colo. 3.
Heare also what S. Peter the apostle of Christ, which wa#
himselfe a married man, saith vnto them that are married, Yee
husband#, dwell with your wyue# according to knowledge,
giuing honour vnto the wife a# vnto the weaker vessell, and a#
heire# together of the grace of life, so that your prayer# be not
hindred.
1. Pet. 3.
Hetherto yee haue heard the duety of the husband toward
the wife. Now likewise yee wiue#, heare and learne your duetie#
toward your husband#, euen a# it i# plainely set forth in
holy Scripture.
S. Paul in the aforenamed Epistle to the Ephesian#, teacheth
you thu#: Ye women, submit your selue# vnto your owne
husband# a# vnto the Lord. For the husband i# the wiue#

the Sauiour of the whole body.
Epheſ. 5.
Therefore a# the Church or Congregation, i# subiect vnto
Christ: so likewise let the wiue# also be in subiection vnto their
owne husband# in all thing#. And againe he saith, Let the
wife reuerence her husband. And in hi# Epistle to the Collossian#,
S. Paule giueth you thi# short lesson, Ye wiue#, submit
your selue# vnto your owne husband#, a# it i# conuenient in
the Lord.
Saint Peter also doeth instruct you very godly, thu# saying,
Let wyue# be subiect to their owne husband#, so that if any
obey not the word, they may bee wonne withoute the word, by
the conuersation of the wiue#, while they behold your chaste
conuersation coupled with feare. Whose apparell let it not bee 
outward, with braided haire and trimming about with gold,
either in putting on of gorgeous# apparell, but let the hid man
which i# in the heart, be without all corruption, so that the
spirit be milde and quiet, which i# a precious# thing in the
sight of God. For after thi# maner in the old time did the holy
women which trusted in GOD apparell themselues#, being
subiect to their owne husband#, a# Sara obeyed Abraham
calling him lord, whose daughter# yee are made, doing well,
and being not dismayed with any feare.

Am the resurrection and the life (saith the Lord.)
He that beleeueth in me, yea, though he were dead,

¶ When they come to the graue, while the Corps is made ready to bee laid

An that i# borne of a woman hath but a short time
to liue, and i# full of misery. Hee commeth vp, and i# cut downe like a flower, he fleeth a# it

In the mid# of life we bee in death : of whom may we seeke

displeased? Yet O Lord God most holy, O Lord most mighty,
Iob 14. 
O holy, and most mercifull Sauiour, deliuer v# not into the
bitter paine# of eternall death. Thou knowest Lord the secret#
of our heart#, shut not vp thy mercifull eye# to our prayer# :
but spare v# Lord moste holy, O God most mighty, O holy
and mercifull Sauiour, thou most worthy Judge eternall, suffer
v# not at our last houre for any paine# of death to fall from
thee.
¶ Then while the earth all be ca vpon the body by ſome anding by, the
Prie all ſay.
Orasmuch a# it hath pleased Almighty God of hi#
great mercy to take vnto himselfe the soule of our
deare brother here departed, we therfore commit hi#
body to the ground, earth to earth, ashe# to ashe#,
dust to dust, in sure and certain hope of resurrection to eternall
life, through our Lord Jesu# Christ, who shall change our vile
body that it may bee like vnto hi# gloriou# body, according to
the mighty working, whereby he i# able to subdue all thing# to
himselfe.
Then all be ſaid or ſung.
Heard a voice from heauen saying vnto me, Write,
from henceforth blessed are the dead, which die in the
Lord. Euen so sayeth the Spirite, that they rest from
their labour#.
Reue. 14,
15.
¶ Then all follow this Leon, taken out of the xv. Chapter to the Corinthians,
the fir Epile.
Hrist i# risen from the dead, and become the first
fruit# of them that sleepe. For by a man came
death, and by a man came the resurrection of the
dead. For a# by Adam all die, euen so by Christ
shal all bee made aliue, but euery man in hi#
owne order. The first i# Christ, then they that are Christ# at
hi# comming. Then commeth the end, when he hath deliuered
vp the kingdome to God the Father, when he hath put downe
all rule, and all authority and power. For hee must reigne till
he haue put hi# enemie# vnder hi# feete. The last enemy that
shall be destroyed i# death. For hee hath put all thing# vnder
hi# feete. But when hee saith, all thing# are put vnder him, it
1. Corin. 15,
20. 
i# manifest that he i# excepted that hath put all thing# vnder
hym. When all thing# are subdued vnto him, then shall the
Sonne also himselfe be subiecte vnto him that put all thing#
vnder him, that God may be all in all. Else what doe they
which are baptized ouer the dead, if the dead rise not at all?
Why are they then baptized ouer them? yea, and why stand we
alway then in ieopardy? By our reioycing which I haue in
Christ Jesu our Lord, I die dayly. That I haue fought with
beast# at Ephesu# after the manner of men, what aduantageth
it me, if the dead rise not againe? Let v# eate and drinke, for
to morrow wee shall die. Bee not yee deceiued; euill word#
corrupt good manner#. Awake truely out of sleepe, and sinne
not. For some haue not the knowledge of God. I speake thi#
to your shame. But some man will say How arise the dead?
With what body shall they come? Thou foole, that which thou
sowest i# not quickened except it die. And what sowest thou?
Thou sowest not that body that shall bee, but bare corne, a# of
wheat or some other : but God giueth it a body at hi# pleasure,
to euery seede hi# owne body. All flesh i# not one manner of
flesh : but there i# one manner of flesh of men, another manner
of flesh of beast#, another of fishe#, an other of bird#. There
are also celestiall bodie#, and there are bodie# terrestriall. But
the glory of the celestiall i# one, and the glory of the terrestriall
i# another. There i# one manner glory of the Sunne, and
another glory of the Moone, and another glory of the Starre#.
For one Starre differeth from another in glory. So i# the
resurrection of the dead. It i# sowen in corruption, it riseth
againe in incorruption. It i# sowen in dishonour, it riseth
againe in honour. It i# sowen in weaknesse, it riseth againe in
power. It i# sowen a natural body, it riseth againe a spirituall
body. There i# a natural body, and there i# a spirituall body :
a# it i# also written, The first man Adam wa# made a liuing
soule, and the last Adam wa# made a quickening spirite. Howbeit
that i# not first which i# spirituall, but that which i# natureall
and then that which i# spirituall. The first man i# of
the earth, earthy. The second man i# the Lord from heauen,
heauenly. A# i# the earthy, such are they that be earthy. And
a# i# the heauenly, such are they that are heauenly. And a# we
haue borne the image of the earthy, so shall we beare the 
image of the heauenly. Thi# say I, brethren, that flesh and
blood cannot inherite the Kingdome of God, neither doth
corruption inherite incorruption. Behold, I shew you a mystery.
We shall not all sleepe : but we shall all be changed, and
that in a moment, in the twinckling of an eye, by the last
trumpe. For the trumpe shall blow, and the deade shall rise incorruptible,
and we shall be changed. For thi# corruptible must
put on incorruption, and thi# mortall must put on immortality.
When thi# corruptible hath put on incorruption, and thi# mortall
hath put on immortality, then shall be brought to passe the
saying that i# written : Death i# swallowed vp in victory :
Death, where i# thy sting? Hell, where i# thy victory? The
sting of death i# sinne, and the strength of sinne i# the Law.
But thanke# be vnto God, which hath giuen v# victory
through our Lord Jesu# Christ. Therfore my deare brethren,
be yee stedfast and vnmouable, alwaye# rich in the worke of
the Lord, forasmuch a# yee know how that your labour i# not
in vaine in the Lord.
¶ The Leon ended, the Prie all ſay.
Lord haue mercie vpon v#.
 Christe haue mercie vpon v#.
Lord haue mercie vpon v#.
 ¶ Our Father which art in heauen. &c.
And leade v# not into temptation.
Anſwere.
But deliuer v# from euill. Amen.
The Prie.
Lmightie God, with whom doe liue the spirit#
of them that depart hence in the Lord,
and in whom the soule# of them that be elected,
after they be deliuered from the burden
of the flesh, be in ioy and felicitie : Wee giue
thee heartie thanke# for that it hath pleased
thee to deliuer thi# N. our brother, out of
the miserie# of thi# sinfull world beseeching thee, that it may
please thee of thy graciou# goodnesse, shortly to accomplish the
numbre of thine elect, and to hasten thy Kingdome, that wee
with thi# our brother, and all other departed in the true faith 
of thy holy Name, may haue our perfect consummation and
blisse, both in body and soule in thy eternall and euerlasting
glory. Amen.
¶ The Colle.
Mercifull God, the Father of our Lord
Jesu# Christ, who i# the resurrection
and the life, in whom whosoeuer beleeueth
shall liue, though he die, and
whosoeuer liueth, and beleeueth in him,
shall not die eternally : who also taught
v# (by hi# holy Apostle Paul) not to be
sorry a# men without hope, for them
that sleepe in him : We meekely beseeche
thee (O Father) to raise v# from the death of sinne,
vnto the life of righteousnesse, that when we shall depart thi#
life, wee may rest in him, a# our hope i# thi# our brother
doeth, and that at the generall Resurrection in the last day, we
may be found acceptable in thy sight, and receiue that blessing
which thy well beloued Sonne shall then pronounce to all that
loue and fear thee, saying, Come ye blessed children of my
Father, receiue the Kingdome prepared for you from the
beginning of the world. Grant thi#, wee beseeche thee, O mercifull

¶ THE PREFACE.
T is euident unto all men, diligently reading
holye Scripture, and ancient Authors,
that from the Apoles time, there hath
beene theſe orders of Miniers in Chris
church, Biſhops, Pries, and Deacons,
Which offices were euermore had in ſuch
reuerent eimation, that no man by his
own priuate authoritie, might preſume to
execute any of them, except he were fir
called, tried, examined, and knowne to haue ſuch qualities, as were
requiſite for the ſame. And alſo by publique prayer, with impo-
ſition of hands, approued, and admitted thereunto. And therefore to
the intent theſe orders ſhould bee continued, and reuerently vſed, and
eeemed in this Church of England, it is requiſite that no man (not
being at this preſente Biſhop, Prie, nor Deacon) ſhall execute any
of them, except hee bee called, tried, examined, and admitted,
according to the forme hereafter following. And none ſhall be
admitted a Deacon, except hee bee twenty one yeeres of age at the
lea. And euery man, which is to bee admitted a Prie, ſhall bee
full foure and twentie yeeres old. And euery man, which is to be
conſecrated a Biſhop, ſhall be fully thirtie yeeres of age. And the
Biſhop knowing either by himſelfe, or by ſufficient teimony, any
perſon to be a man of vertuous conuerſation, and without crime,
and after examination and tryall, findyng him learned in the Latine
tongue, and ſufficientlye inrued in holy Scripture, maye vpon
a Sunday or holy day, in the face of the Church, admit
him a Deacon in ſuch manner and forme
as hereafter followeth. 
The Forme and manner of Ordering
of DEACONS .
Ir, when the day appointed by the Biſhop is come,
there ſhall be an exhortation, declaring the duetie and
office of ſuch as come to be admitted Miniers, how
nece ary ſuch orders are in the Church of Chri, and
alſo how the people ought to eeeme them in their
vocation.
 After the exhortation ended, the Archedeacon or his
Deputie, hall preſent ſuch as ſhall come the Biſhop to
bee admitted, ſaying theſe words.
 Euerend Father in God, I p°eƒente vnto you, theƒe perƒones p°e-
ƒent, to be admitted Deacons.
The Biſhop.
Ake heed that the perƒons whom yee p°eƒente vnto vs, bee apt
and meet, for their learning and godly conuerƒation, to exerciƒe their miniƒterie duely, to the honour of God, and edifying of his
Church.
The Archedeacon ſhall anſwere.
Haue enquired of them, and alƒo examined them, and thinke them
ƒo to be.
And then the Biſhop ſhall ſay vnto the people.
Reth°ren, if there be any of you, who knoweth any impediment,
or notable crime, in any of theƒe perƒones presented to be ordered Deacons, for the which hee ought not to bee admitted to the
ƒame, let him come foo°th in the name of God, and ƒhewe what the
crime o° impediment is.
And if any great crime, or impediment be obieed, the Biſhoppe ſhall ſurceaſe,
from ordering that perſon, vntill ſuch time as the party accuſed ſhall trie
himſelf cleare of that crime.
Then the Biſhop, commending ſuch as ſhall be found meet to bee ordered to the
prayers of the Congregation, with the Clearkes, and people preſent, ſhall
ſay or ſing the Letany as followeth, with the prayers.

O Lorde ariſe, helpe vs, and deliuer vs, for thy Names ſake.
O God, we haue heard with our eares, and oure fathers haue declared

 O Lord ariſe, helpe vs, and deliuer vs, for thine honour.
 Glory be to the Father, and to the Sonne : and to the holy Gho¥.
As it was in the begynning, is now, and euer ƒhall be, wo°ld
without end. Amen.
 From our enemies defend vs, O Chri¥.
Graciouſly looke vpon our affliions.
Pitifully behold the ƒo°rowes of our hearts.
Mercifully forgiue the ſinnes of thy people.
Fauourably with mercy heare our prayers.
O Sonne of Dauid haue mercy vpon vs.
Both now and euer voucheƒafe to heare vs, O Chri¥.
Graciouſly heare vs, O Chri, Graciouſly heare vs, O Lord Chri.
The Verſicle.
O Lord let thy mercy be ƒhewed vpon vs.
The Anſwere.
As we doe put our tru± in thee. 
¶ Let vs pray. E humbly beƒeech thee, O father, mercifully to look vpon
our infirmities, and fo° the glo°y of thy Names ƒake, turne from vs all thoƒe euils that wee mo¥ righteouƒly haue deƒerued: and grant that in all our troubles we may put our whole tru¥ and
confidence in thy mercy, and euermo°e ƒerue thee in holine±e and
purene±e of liuing, to thy honour and glo°y, th°ough our onely
Mediatour and Aduocate Jeƒus Ch°i¥ our Lo°d. Amen.
Lmightie God, which ha¥ giuen vs grace at this time with one
acco°d to make our common ƒupplications vnto the, and doe¥
p°omiƒe that when two o° th°ee bee gathered together in thy Name,
thou wilt grant their reque¥s: fulfill now, O Lord, the deƒires and
petitions of thy ƒeruants, as may be mo¥ expedient fo° them,
granting vs in this wo°ld, knowledge of thy truth, and in the wo°ld
to come life euerla¥ing. Amen.
¶ Then ſhall bee ſaid alſo this that followeth.
Lmighty God, which by thy diuine p°ouidence, ha¥
appointed diuers o°ders of Mini¥ers in the Church,
and didde¥ inƒpire thine holy Apo¥les to chuƒe vnto
this o°der of Deacons, the fir¥ Marty° S. Stephen,
with other: mercifully behold theƒe thy ƒeruants, now called to the like office and admini¥ration; repleniƒhe them ƒo
with the trueth of thy doctrine, and innocency of life, that, both by
wo°d and good example, they may faithfully ƒerue thee in this office,
to the glo°y of thy Name, and p°ofite of the Congregation,
th°ough the merits of our Sauiour Jeƒu Chri¥, who liueth and
reigneth with thee and the holy Gho¥, now and for ever. Amen.
Then ſhall be ſung or ſaid the Communion of the day, ſauing the Epile ſhall
be read out of Timothie, as followeth.
Ikewiƒe mu¥ the Mini¥ers be hone¥, not double tongued,
not giuen vnto much wine, neither greedy of filthy lucre,
but holding the my¥ery of the faith, with a pure conƒci- ence: and let them fir¥ be p°ooued, and then let them mini¥er, ƒo
that no man be able to rep°oue them. Even ƒo mu¥ their wiues be
hone¥, not euil ƒpeakers, but ƒober and faithfull in all things. Let
the Deacons be the huƒbands of one wife, and ƒuche as rule their
child°en well, and their owne houƒholds: Fo° they that mini¥er
W
A
well, get themƒelves a good degree, and a great liberty in the faith, which is in Chri¥ Jeƒu.
 Theƒe things write I vnto thee tru¥ing to come ƒho°tly vnto thee;
but and if I tarry long, that then thou maye¥ yet haue knowledge, how thou oughte¥ to behaue thy ƒelf in the houƒe of God, which is
the congregation of the living God, the pillar and ground of truth.
And without doubt, great is that my¥ery of godlyne±e. God was
ƒhewed in the fleƒh, was iu¥ified in the ƒpirit, was seene among the
Angels, was p°eached vnto the Gentiles, was beleeued on in the
wo°ld, and receiued up in glory.
Or elſe this out of the ſixth of
the As.
Hen the twelve called the multitude of the Diƒciples together,
and ƒaid, It is not meet that we ƒhould leaue the wo°d of God,
and ƒerue tables. Wherefo°e b°eth°en, looke yee out among you,
ƒeuen men of hone¥ repo°t and full of the holy Gho¥ and wiƒdome,
to whom wee may commit this buƒine±e: but wee will giue our
ƒelues continually to p°aier, and to the admini¥ration of the wo°d.
And that ƒaying pleaƒed the whole multitude. And they choƒe Stephen,
a man ful of faith, and full of the holy Gho¥, and Philip, and P°ocho°us, and Nicano°, and Timon, and Permenas, and Nicholas
a conuert of Antioch. Theƒe they ƒet befo°e the Apo¥les: and when
they had p°ayed, they laid their hands on them. And the wo°d of
God increaƒed, and the nomber of the Diƒciples multiplied in Jeru-
ƒalem greatly, and a great company of the P°ie¥s, were obedient
vnto the faith.
And before the Goſpell, the Biſhop ſitting in a chaire, ſhall cauſe the Oath
of the Kings ſupremacie, and again the power and authoritie of all
forreigne Pontentates, to bee minired vnto euery of them that are to be
ordered.
 The Oath of the Kings
Soueraignetie.
A. B. do vtterly te¥ifie and declare in my conƒcience that the Kings Highne±e is the onely ƒup°eam Gouernour of

Then ſhall the Biſhop examine euery one of them that are to bee ordered, in the
preſence of the people, after this manner following.
Oe you tru¥ that you are inwardly mooued by the holy
Gho¥, to take vpon you this o¤ice and mini¥ration, to ƒerue God, fo° the p°omotinge of his glo°y, and the edifying of his people?
Anſwere.
I tru¥ ƒo.
The Biſhop.
Doe you thinke that yee truly be called acco°ding to the will of
our Lo°d Jeƒus Chri¥, and the due o°der of this Realme, to the
Mini¥ery of the Church?
Anſwere.
I thinke ƒo.
The Biſhop.
Doe you unfainedly beleeue all the Canonicall Scriptures, of
the old and new Te¥ament?
Anſwere.
I doe beleeue.
The Biſhop.
Ill you diligently reade the ƒame vnto the people a±embled in
the Church, where you ƒhall be appointed to ƒerue?
Anſwere.
I will.
The Biſhop.
T aopertaineth to the o¤ice of a Deacon in the Church, where he
ƒhall be appointed to a±i¥ the P°ie¥ in deuine Seruice, and ƒpecially
when he mini¥reth the holy Communion, and to helpe him in
di¥ribucion thereof, and to reade holy Scriptures and Homilies in
the Congregation, and to in¥ruct the youth in the Cathechiƒme, to
baptize and to p°eache if he bee admitted thereto by the Biƒhop. And
furthermo°e, it is his o¤ice, where p°ouiƒion is ƒo made, to ƒearch
for the ƒicke, poo°e, and impotent people of the Pariƒh, and to intiD

W
I 
mate their e¥ates, names, and places where they dwell vnto the
Curate, that by his exho°tation they may bee relieued by the Pa- riƒh or other conuenient almes: wil you doe this gladly and willingly?

Anſwere.
I will ƒo doe by the helpe of God.
The Biſhop.
Ill you applie all youre diligence to frame and faƒhion your
owne liues, and the liues of all your familie acco°ding to the doctrin of Chri¥, and to make both your ƒelues and them as much
as in you lieth, wholeƒome examples of the flocke of Chri¥?
Anſwere.
I will ƒo doe, the Lord being my helper.
The Biſhop.
Ill you reuerently obey your Ordinary and other chiefe
Mini¥ers of the Church, and them to whom the gouernement
and charge is committed ouer you, following with a glad
minde and will their godly admonitions?
Anſwere.
I will indeauour my ƒelfe, the Lo°d being my helper.
Then the Biſhop laying his hands ſeuerally vpon the head of euery of them,
ſhall saye.
Take thou authority to execute the o¤ice of a Deacon in the
Church of God committed vnto thee: In the Name of the Father,
the Sonne, and the holy Gho¥. Amen.
Then ſhal the Biſhop deliuer to euery one of them the New Teament, ſaying.
Take thou autho°itie to reade the Goƒpel in the Church of God,
and to p°each the ƒame, if thou be thereto o°dinarily commanded.
 Then one of them appointed by the Biſhop, ſhall reade the Goſpel of that day.
 Then ſhall the Biſhop proceed to the Communion, and all that are ordered shall
tarry and receiue the holy Communion the ſame day with the Biſhop.
The Communion ended, after the la Colle, and immediately before the
Benediction, ſhall be ſaid this Colle following.
Lmighty God, giuer of all good thinge, which of thy great
goodne±e ha¥ vouchƒafed to accept and take theƒe thy ƒeruants vnto the o¤ices of Deacons in thy Church: make them wee beƒeech thee (O Lo°d) to bee mode¥, humble, and con¥ant in their mini-
¥ration, to haue a ready will to obƒerue all ƒpirituall diƒcipline, that
W
W
A
they hauing alwayes the te¥imony of a good conƒcience, and continuing
euer ƒtable and ƒtrong in thy Sonne Chri¥, may ƒo well uƒe themƒelues in this inferiour o¤ice, that they may be found worthy
to bee called vnto the higher mini¥eries in thy Church, th°ough the
ƒame thy Sonne our Sauiour Chri¥, to whom be glory and
honour, wo°ld without end. Amen.
And here it mu bee ſhewed vnto the Deacon that hee mu continue in that
office of a Deacon, the ſpace of a whole yeere at the lea (except for reasonable
cauſes, it bee otherwiſe ſeene to his Ordenary) to the intent hee may be
perfe, and well expert in the things appertaining to the Eccleſiaicall
adminiration, in executing whereof, if he be found faithful and diligent, he
may be admitted by his Dioceſan to the order of Priehood.
¶ The forme of Ordering
of Pries.
When the exhortacion is ended, then ſhall follow the Communion. And for the
Epile ſhall bee read out of the twentieth Chapter of the Aes of the
Apoles as followeth.

Rom Mileto, Paul ƒent me±engers to Epheƒus, and
called the Elders of the Congregation; which when
they were come to him, hee ƒaid unto them. Yee know,
that from the fir± day that I came into Aƒia, after what manner I haue beene with you at all ƒeaƒons, ƒeruiyng the Lo°d with all humblene±e of minde, and with many teares and
temptations which happened vnto me by the layings await of the Jewes, because I would keepe backe nothing that was p°ofitable
vnto you, but to ƒhew you, and teach you openly th°oughout euery
houƒe: witne±ing both to the Jewes, and alƒo to the G°eekes, the
repentance that is toward GOD, and the faith which is toward
our Lord Jeƒus. And now behold, I goe bound in the ƒpirit vnto
Hieruƒalem, not knowing the things that ƒhall come on me there,
but that the holy Gho¥ witne±eth in euery Citie, ƒaying that bands 
and trouble abide mee. But none of theƒe things mooue me, neither
is my life deare vnto my ƒelfe, that I might fulfill my courƒe with ioy and the mini¥ration of the wo°d which I haue receiued of the
Lord Jesu, to te¥ifie the Goƒpel of the grace of God. And now
behold, I am ƒure that hencefo°th yee all (th°ough whom I haue
gone p°eaching the kingdome of God) ƒhall ƒee my face no more.
Wherefore I take you to reco°d this day, that I am pure from the
blood of all men: For I haue ƒpared no labour, but haue ƒhewed you
all the counsell of God. Take heed therefo°e vnto your ƒelues, and
to all the flocke among whom the holy Gho¥ hath made you ouerƒeers, to rule the Congregation of God, which hee hath purchaƒed
with his blood. Fo° I am sure of this, that after my departing,
ƒhall grieuous woolues enter in among you, not ƒparing the
flocke. Mo°eouer, of your owne ƒelues ƒhall men ariƒe, ƒpeaking
peruerƒe things, to d°aw diƒciples after them. Therefo°e awake,
and remember that by the ƒpace of th°ee yeeres I ceaƒed not to
warne euery one of you night and day, with teares.
 And now b°eth°en, I commend you to God, and to the wo°d of his
grace, which is able to build further, and to giue you an inheritance
among all them which are ƒanctified. I haue deƒired no mans
ƒiluer, gold, o° ve¥ure. Yea, you know your ƒelues, that theƒe hands
haue mini¥red vnto my nece±ities, and vnto them that were with
mee. I haue ƒhewed you all things, how that so labouring yee ought
to receiue the weake, and to remember the wo°ds of the Lo°de
Jeƒus, how that hee ƒaid; It is mo°e ble±ed to giue, than to receiue.
Or elſe this third Chapter, of the fir Epile to Timothie.
His is a true ƒaying, If any man deƒire the o¤ice of a
Biƒhop, he desireth an hone¥ wo°k. A Biƒhop therefo°e
mu¥ be blamele±e, the huƒband of one wife, vigilant, ƒobre,
diƒcrete, a keeper of hoƒpitalitie, apt to teach, not
giuen to ouer much wine, no fighter, nor greedy of filthy lucre, but
gentle, abho°ring fighting, abho°ring couetouƒne±e, one that ruleth
well his own houƒe, one that hath child°en in ƒubiection with all
reuerence. Fo° if a man cannot rule his owne houƒe, how ƒhall hee
care for the Congregation of God? He may not be a yong Scholer,
le¥ he ƒwell, and fall into the iudgement of the euill ƒpeaker. He
mu¥ alƒo have a good repo°t of them which are without; le¥ hee fall
into rebuke, and ƒnare of the euill ƒpeaker.
 Likewiƒe mu¥ the Mini¥ers bee hone¥, not double tongued, not
giuen vnto much wine, neither grerdy of filthy lucre; but holding
1. Tim. 3.
This when
Deacons and
Pries are
made both in
one day. 
the mi¥erie of the faith, with a pure conƒcience: and let them fir¥ be
p°ooued, and then let them mini¥er ƒo that no man be able to rep°ooue
them.
 Euen ƒo mu¥ their wiues be hone¥, not euill ƒpeakers: but sober
and faithfull in all things. Let the Deacons be the huƒbands of one
wife, and ƒuch as rule their child°en well, and their owne houƒholds:
Fo° they that mini¥er well get themƒelues a good degree, and great
liberty in the faith which is in Ch°i¥ Jeƒus. Theƒe things write I
vnto thee, tru¥ing to come ƒho°tly vnto thee: but if I tarry long, that then thou maye¥ haue yet knowledge, how thou oughte¥ to
behaue thy ƒelfe in the houƒe of God, which is the Vongregacion of
the liuing God, the pillar and ground of trueth.
And without doubt, great is that my¥erie of godline±e: God was
ƒhewed in the fleƒh, was iu¥ified in the Spirit, was ƒeene among the
Angels, was p°eached vnto the Gentiles, was beleeued on in the
wo°ld, and receiued up in glory.
After this shall be read for the Goſpel a piece of the la Chapter
of Mathew, as followeth.
Eƒus came and ƒpake vnto them, ƒaying: All power is giuen vnto me in heauen and in earth: Goe ye therefo°e and teach all Nations,
baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the holy Gho¥, teaching them to obƒerue all things, whatƒoeuer
I haue commanded you : and loe, I am with you alway, euen
vntil the end of the wo°ld.
Or elſe this that followeth, of the tenth Chapter of Iohn.
Erily, verely, I ƒay vnto you, He that entreth not in by the doo°e into the ƒheepefold, but climbeth up ƒome other way, the ƒame is a thiefe and a murtherer. But hee that entreth in by the doo°e, is the ƒhepeherd of the ƒheepe, to him the po°ter openeth, and
the ƒheepe heare his voyce, and hee calleth his owne ƒheepe by name,
and leadeth them out. And when hee hath sent foo°th his owne
ƒheepe, hee goeth befo°e them, and the sheepe follow him, fo° they know his voice. A ¥ranger will they not follow, but will flee from
him, for they know not the voyce of ¥rangers. This p°ouerbe ƒpake
Jeƒus vnto them, but they vnder¥ood not what things they were
which hee ƒpake vnto them. Then ƒaid Jeƒus vnto them againe,
Verely, verely, I ƒay vnto you, I am the doo°e of the sheepe: and
all (euen as many as come befo°e mee) are theeues and murderers, but the ƒheepe did not heare them. I am the doo°e : by me if any
I
V
man enter in, he ƒhall be ƒafe, and goe in and out, and finde pa¥ure.
A thiefe cometh not but fo° to ¥eale, kill and to de¥roy. I am come,
that they might haue life, and that they might haue it mo°e abundantly.
I am the good ƒhepherd. A good ƒhepherd giueth his life fo°
the ƒheepe. An hired ƒeruant, and he which is not the shepherd
(neither the ƒheepe are his owne) ƒeeth the wolfe comming, and leaueth
the sheepe and fleeth, and the wolfe catcheth and ƒcattereth the
ƒheepe. The hired ƒervant fleeth, becauƒe hee is an hired ƒeruaunt,
and careth not for the ƒheepe. I am the good ƒhepherd and know my ƒheepe, and am knowne of mine. As my Father knoweth me, euen
ƒo know I alƒo my Father. And I giue my life fo° the ƒheepe. And
other ƒheepe I haue, which are not of this fold: them alƒo mu¥ I
bring, and they ƒhall heare my voyce, and there ƒhall be one foldm and one ƒhepherd.
Or elſe this, of the xx. Chapter of Iohn.
He ƒame day at night, which was the fir¥ day of the Sab- bothes, when the doo°es were ƒhut (where the Diƒciples were a±embled together, fo° feare of the Jewes) came Jeƒus and ¥ood in
the mid¥, and ƒayd vnto them, Peace be vnto you. And when hee
had ƒo ƒayd, he ƒhewed vnto them his hands & his ƒide. Then were
the Diƒciples glad, when they ƒaw the Lo°d. Then ƒaid Jeƒus vnto
them againe, Peace be vnto you: As my Father ƒent me, euen ƒo ƒend I you alƒo. And when he had ƒaid thoƒe wo°ds, he b°eathed on them
and ƒayd vnto them, Receiue ye the holy Gho¥: Whoƒoeuers ƒinnes
yee remit, they are remitted vnto them: and whoƒoeuers ƒinnes ye
retaine, they are retained.
When the Goſpel is ended, then ſhall be ſayd or ſung.
Ome holy Gho¥ eternall God p°oceeding from aboue:
Both from the Father and the Sonne, the God of peace and
loue:
Viƒit oure minds, and into us, thy heauenly grace inƒpire:
That in all truth and godline±e, we may haue true deƒire.
Thou art the very Comforter, in all woe and diƒtre±e:
The heauenly gifte of God mo¥ high, which no tongue can expre±e.

The fountaine and the liuely sp°ing, of ioy cele¥iall:
The fire ƒo bright, the loue ƒo cleare, and Vnction ƒpirituall.
Thou in thy giftes art manifold, whereby Chri¥es Church doth ¥and:
In faithfull hearts w°iting thy Law, the finger of Gods hand.
T
C
Acco°ding to thy p°omiƒe made, thou giue¥ ƒpeech of grace:
That th°ough thy helpe, the p°aiƒe of God, may ƒound in euery
place.
O holy Gho¥, into oure wits, ƒend downe thy heauenly light:
Kindle our hearts with feruent loue, to ƒerue God day and night. Strength and ¥abliƒh all our weakene±e, ƒo feeble and ƒo fraile:
That neither fleƒh, the world, no° deuill, again¥ us do p°euaile.
Put backe our enemie farre from us, and grant us to obtaine,
Peace in our hearts, with God and man, without grudge o°
disdaine.
And grant O Lo°d that thou being, our leader and our guide:
We may eƒchewe the ƒnares of ƒinne, and from thee neuer ƒlide.
To us ƒuch plentie of thy grace, good Lo°d grant we thee p°ay:
That thou maye¥ be our Comforter, at the la¥ d°eadfull day.
Of all ¥rife and di±ention, O Lo°d, di±olue the bands:
And make the knots of peace and loue, th°oughout all Chri¥ian
lands.
Grant vs O Lo°d, th°ough thee to know the Father mo¥ of
might:
That of his deare beloued Sonne, we may attaine the ƒight,
And that with perfect fayth alƒo, we may acknowledge thee;
The Spirit of them both alway, one God in perƒons th°ee.
Laude and p°aiƒe be to the Father, and to the Sonne equall:
And to the holy Spirite alƒo, one God coeternall.
And p°ay wee that the onely Sonne, vouchƒafe his Spirite to
ƒend:
To all that doe profe±e his Name, vnto the wo°lds end. Amen.
And then the Archdeacon ſhall preſent vnto the Biſhop, all them that ſhall
receiue the order of Priehood that day, the Archedeacon ſayinge,
Euerend Father in God, I preƒent vnto you, theƒe perƒons, p°e-
ƒent, to be admitted to the o°der of P°ie¥hood,
Cum interrogatione & reſponſione, vt in ordine Diaconatus.
And then the Biſhop ſhall ſay to the people,
Ood people, theƒe bee they whom wee purpoƒe, God willing, to
receiue this day vnto the holy o¤ice of P°ie¥hood. Fo° after due examination, we finde not to the contrary, but that they be lawfully called to their function and mini¥erie, and that they bee
perƒons meet fo° the ƒame: but yet if there bee any of you, which
R
G 
knoweth any impediment, o° notable cryme in any of them, fo° the
which hee oughte not to be receiued into this holy mini¥erie, now in the Name of God declare the ƒame.
And if any great crime or impediment be obiected,
Vt ſupra in Ordine Diaconatus vſque ad finem Letanie cum hac Collea.
Lmighty God, giuer of all good thinges, which by thy holy
Spirit ha¥ appointed diuers o°ders of Mini¥ers in thy Church, mercifully behold theƒe thy ƒervants, now called to the office
of Prie¥hood, and repleniƒh them ƒo with the truth of thy doctrine,
and innocencie of life, that both by wo°de and good example,
they may faithfully serue thee in this o¤ice, to the glo°y of thy
Name, and p°ofit of the Congregation, th°ough the merits of our
Sauiour Jeƒus Chri¥, who liueth and reigneth, with thee and the
holy Gho¥, wo°ld without end. Amen.

Then the Biſhop ſhall minier vnto euery of them the Oath,
concerning the Kings Supremacie, as it is ſet forth in the
order of Deacons, and that done, hee ſhall ſay vnto them,
which are appointed to receiue the ſaid office, as hereafter
followeth.
Ou haue heard b°eth°en, aƒwell in youre p°iuate examination,
as in the exho°tation, and in the holy Le±ons taken out of the Goƒpel, and of the w°itings of the Apo¥les, of what dignity, and of
how great impo°tance this o¤ice is, (whereunto yee be called). And now wee exho°t you, in the Name of our Lo°d Jeƒus Chri¥, to haue
in rememb°ance into how high a dignity, and to how chargeable an
o¤ice yee be called, that is to ƒay, to be the me±engers, the watchmen,
the Pa¥ours, and the Stewards of the Lo¥d to teach, to p°emoniƒhe,
to feede, and p°ouid for the Lo°ds family: to ƒeek for
Ch°i¥s ƒheepe that be diƒperƒed ab°oad, and fo° his child°en which bee
in the midde¥ of this naughty wo°ld, to bee ƒaued th°ough Ch°i¥ fo°
euer. Haue alwayes therfo°e p°inted in your rememb°ance how
great a treaƒure is committed to your charge, fo° they be the ƒheepe
of Ch°i¥, which hee bought with his death, and fo° whom he ƒhed his
blood. The Churche and Congregation whom you mu¥ ƒerue, is
his ƒpouƒe and his body.
And if it ƒhall chance the ƒame Church, o° any membre therof, to
take any hurt or hinderance, by reaƒon of youre negligence, yee
A
Y 
know the greatne±e of the fault, and alƒo of the ho°rible puniƒhment
which will enƒue. Wherfo°e, conƒider with your ƒelues the end of
your mini¥ery, towards the child°en of God, towards the ƒpouƒe
and body of Ch°i¥, and ƒee that you neuer ceaƒe your labour, your care, and diligence, vntill you haue doen all that lieth in you, acco°ding
to your bounden duety, to b°ing all ƒuch as are, o° shall be
committed to your charge, vnto that agreement in faith, and knowledge
of God, and to that ripene±e and perfectne±e of age in Ch°i¥,
that there be no place left among you, either for errour in Religion,
o° fo° viciouƒne±e in life.
Then, fo°aƒmuch as your o¤ice is both of ƒo greate excellencie,
and of ƒo great di¤icultie, ye ƒee with how great care and ¥udy yee
ought to apply your ƒelues, aƒwell that you may ƒhewe your ƒelues
kind to that Lo°d, who hath placed you in so high a dignity, as alƒo
to beware, that neither you your ƒelues o¤end, neither be occaƒion
that other o¤end. Howbeit, ye cannot haue a mind and a wil thereto
of your ƒelues, fo° that power and ability is giuen of God alone.
Therefo°e ye ƒee how ye ought and haue need, earne¥ly to pray fo°
his holy Spirit. And ƒeeing that you cannot by any other meanes compa±e the doing of ƒo weighty a wo°ke pertaining to the ƒaluation
of man, but with doctrine and exho°tacion, taken out of holy Scriptures,
and with a life agreeable unto the ƒame. Ye perceiue how ¥udious yee ought to bee in reading and learning the Scriptures,
and in framing the manners, both of your ƒelues, and of them that
ƒpecially pertaine vnto you, acco°ding to the rule of the ƒame
Scriptures: And fo° this ƒelfe ƒame cauƒe, ye ƒee how yee ought to fo°ƒake and ƒet aƒide (as much as you maye) all wo°ldly cares and ¥udies.
We haue a good hope, that you haue well weighed and pondered
theƒe things with your ƒelues, long befo°e this time, and that you
haue clearly determined, by Gods grace, to giue your ƒelues wholly
to this vocation, wherunto it hath pleaƒed God to call you, ƒo that
(as muche as lieth in you) you apply your ƒelues wholly to this
one thing, and d°aw all your cares and ¥udies this way, and to this
end. And that you will continually p°ay for the heauenly a±i¥ance
of the holy Gho¥, from God the father, by the mediation of our
onely Mediatour and Sauiour Jesus Ch°i¥, that by daily reading
and weighing of the Scriptures, ye may ƒo waxe riper and ¥ronger in your mini¥ery: And that yee may so endeuour your ƒelues from time to time to ƒanctifie the liues of you and yours, and to faƒhion
them after the rule and doctrine of Ch°i¥. And that ye may be wholƒome and godly examples and paternes fo° the re¥ of the 
congregation to folowe: & that this p°eƒent congregation of Ch°i¥
here a±embled, may alƒo under¥and your mindes and wils, in theƒe
things: and that this your p°omise ƒhall more moue you to do your
duties, ye shal anƒwere plainely to these things, which we in the
name of the congregation ƒhall demand of you touching the ƒame.
Doe you thinke in your heart, that you be truely called acco°ding
to the will of our Lo°d Jeƒus Ch°i¥e, and the oƒder of this Church
of England, to the mini¥ery of P°ie¥hood?
Anſwere.
I thinke it.
The Biſhop.
Ee you perƒwaded that the holy ƒcriptures conteine ƒu¤iciently
al doctrine required of nece±itie fo° eternall ƒaluation, thorow
faith in Jeƒu Ch°i¥? And are you determined with the ƒayd
Scriptures, to in¥ruct the people committed to your charge, and to
teach nothing (as required of nece±itie, to eternal ƒaluation) but
that you shall be perƒwaded may be concluded, and p°ooued by the
Scripture?
Anſwere.
I am ƒo perƒwaded, and haue ƒo determined by Gods grace.
The Biſhop.
Ill you then giue your faithfull diligence alwayes, ƒo to mini¥er the doctrine and Sacraments, and the diƒcipline of
Ch°i¥, as the Lo°d hath commanded, and as this Realme hath receiued
the same, acco°ding to the Commandements of God, ƒo that
you may teach the people committed to your cure and charge, with al diligence to keepe and obƒerue the ƒame?
Anſwere.
I wil ƒo doe, by the helpe of the Lo°d.
The Biſhop.
Ill you bee ready with al faithful diligence, to baniƒh and
d°iue away all erroneous and ¥range doctrines, contrary to Gods wo°d, and to use both publike and p°iuate monitions and
exhortations, as well to the ƒicke as to the whole, within youre
cures, as need ƒhall require and occaƒion be giuen?
Anſwere.
I will, the Lo°d being my helper.
The Biſhop.
Ill you bee diligent in p°ayers, and in reading of the holy
Scriptures, and in ƒuch ¥udies as helpe to the knowledge of
the ƒame, laying aƒide the ¥udy of the wo°ld and the fleƒhe?
B
W
W
W
Anſwere.
I will endeuour my selfe ƒo to doe, the Lo°d being my helper.
The Biſhop.
Ill you be diligent to frame and faƒhion your owne ƒelues,
and your families, acco°ding to the doctrine of Ch°i¥, and to make bothe youre ƒelues and them (as much as in you lieth) whol-
ƒome examples and ƒpectacles to the flocke of Ch°i¥?
Anſwere.
I will ƒo apply my ƒelfe, the Lo°d being my helper.
The Biſhop.
Ill you mainetaine and ƒet fo°wards (as much as lyeth in
you) quietnes, peace, and loue, among all Ch°i¥ian people, and ƒpecially among them that are, o° ƒhall be committed to your
charge?
Anſwere.
I will ƒo doe, the Lo°d being my helper.
The Biſhop.
Ill you reuerently obey your O°dinarie, and other chiefe
Mini¥ers, vnto whom the gouernment and charge is committed
ouer you, following with a glad minde and will, their godly admonition, and ƒubmitting your ƒelves to their godly iudgements?
Anſwere.
I will ƒo doe, the Lo°d being my helper.
Then ſhal the Biſhop ſay,
Lmightie God, who hath giuen you this will to doe all theƒe
things, grant alƒo vnto you ¥rength and power to perfo°me the ƒame, that he may accompliƒh his wo°ke which he hath begun in
you, untill the time hee shall come at the latter day, to iudge the
quicke and the dead.
After this, the Congregation ſhall bee deſired ſecretly in their prayers, to make
humble ſupplicacions to God for the foreſaid things : for the whiche prayers,
there ſhall be a certaine ſpace kept in ſilence.
That done, the Biſhop ſhall pray in this wiſe.
¶ Let us praye. Lmightie God and heauenly father, which of thy infinite
loue and goodne±e towards vs, ha¥ giuen to vs thy only & mo¥ deare beloued Son Jeƒus Ch°i¥, to be our

of thy eternall goodne±e, and fo° that thou ha¥ vouchƒafed to

thankful to thee, fo° theƒe and all other thy benefits, & that we may
dayly increaƒe and goe fo°wards, in the knowledge and faith of thee
and thy Sonne, by the holy Spirit. So that as well by theƒe thy
Mini¥ers, as by them to whom they shall be appointed Mini¥ers,
thy holy Name may be alwayes glo°ified, and thy ble±ed kingdome
enlarged, th°ough the ƒame thy Sonne our Lo°de Jeƒus Ch°i¥, which liueth and reigneth with thee, in the unitie of the ƒame holy
Spirite, wo°ld without end. Amen.
When this prayer is done, the Biſhop with the Priees preſent ſhal lay their
hands ſeuerally vpon the head of euery one that receiueth Orders. The
Receiuers humbly kneeling vpon their knees, and the Biſhop ſaying,
Eceiue the holy Gho¥, whoƒe ƒinnes thou doe¥ fo°giue, they
are fo°giuen: and whoƒe ƒinnes thou doe¥ retaine, thei are retained:
and be thou a faithful diƒpenƒer of the wo°d of god, and of his
holy Sacraments. In the name of the Father, and of the Sonne,
and of the holy Gho¥. Amen.
The Biſhop ſhall deliuer to euery one of them the Bible in his hand, ſaying.
Ake thou autho°ity to preach the wo°d of God, and to mini¥er
the holy Sacraments in this Congregation, where thou ƒhalt be ƒo appointed.
When this is done, the Congregation ſhall sing the Creed, and alſo they ſhall goe
to the Communion, which all they that receiue Orders, ſhall take together,
and remaine in the ſame place where the hands were layd vpon them, vntill
ſuch time as they haue receiued the Communion.
The Communion being done, after the la Colle, and immediatly before the
Benediion, ſhall be ſaid this Colle.
O¥ mercifull Father, we beƒeech thee so to ƒend vpon theƒe
thy ƒeruantes thy heauenly ble±ing, that they may bee clad about with all iu¥ice, and that thy wo°d ƒpoken by their mouthes,
may haue ƒuch ƒucce±e, that it may neuer be ƒpoken in vaine. G°ant
alƒo that we may haue grace to heare, and receiue the ƒame as thy
R
T
M 
mo¥ holy wo°d and the meanes of our ƒaluation, that in all our
wo°ds and deeds we may ƒeeke thy glo°y, and the increase of thy
Kingdome, th°ough Jeƒus Ch°i¥ our Lo°d. Amen.
If the Order of Deacon and Priehood, be giuen both vpon one day, then ſhall all
things at the holy Communion bee uſed as they are appointed at the ordering
of Pries, Sauing that for the Epile, the whole third Chapter of the fir to
Timothie ſhall be read, as it is ſet out before in the order of Pries. And
immediatly after the Epile, the Deacons ſhall be ordered. And it ſhall ſuffice
the Letany to be ſaid once.
The Forme of Conſecrating of an
Archbiſhop, or Biſhop.
¶ At the Communion.
The Epile.
His is a true ƒaying, If a man deƒire the office of a
Biƒhop he deƒireth an hone¥ wo°k. A Biƒhop therefo°e
mu¥ be blamele±e, the huƒband of one wife,
diligent, ƒober, diƒcrete, a keeper of hoƒpitality, apt to teach, not giuen to ouermuch wine, no fighter, not
greedy of filthy lucre, but gentle, abho°ring fighting, abho°ring
couetouƒne±e, one that ruleth well his own houƒe, one that hath children
in ƒubiection with all reuerence. Fo° if a man cannot rule his
owne houƒe, how shall he care fo° the Congregation of God? Hee
may not be a yong ƒcholler, le¥ he ƒwell and fall into the iudgement
of the euill speaker. He mu¥ alƒo haue a good repo°t of them which
are without, le¥ he fall into rebuke, and the ƒnare of the euill
ƒpeaker.
The Goſpel.
Eƒus ƒaid to Simon Peter, Simon Johanna, loue¥ thou mee,
more than theƒe? Hee ƒaid vnto him, yea, Lo°d, thou knowe¥ that
I loue thee: hee ƒaid vnto him, feed my Lambes. He ƒaid to him
againe the ƒeconde time: Simon Johanna, loue¥ thou me? He ƒaied
vnto him, Yea Lo°d, thou knowe¥ that I loue thee: he ƒaied vnto
I 
him, Feede my ƒheepe. He ƒaid vnto him the third time, Simon
Johanna, loue¥ thou me? Peter was ƒo°ry, becauƒe he ƒaid vnto hym the third time, Love¥ thou me? And hee ƒaid vnto him, Lo°d thou
knowe¥ all things, thou knowe¥ that I loue thee. Jeƒus ƒaid vnto
him, Feed my ƒheepe.
Or elſe out of the tenth Chapiter of Iohn: as before in the order of Pries.
After the Goſpel and Creed ended: fir the eleed Biſhop ſhall bee
preſented by two Biſhops vnto the Archbiſhop of that Prouince, or to
ſome other Biſhop appointed by his commiion: the Biſhops that preſent
him, ſaying.
O¥ reuerend Father in God, we preƒent vnto you this godly and well learned man to be conƒecrated Biƒhop.
Then ſhall the Archbiſhop demand the Kings mandate for the conſecration and
cauſe it to bee read, and the Oath touching the knowledge of the Kings
Supremacie, ſhall be minired to the perſons eleed, as it is ſet out in the
order of Deacons. And then ſhall bee minired alſo the Oath of due obedience
vnto the Archbiſhop, as followeth.

The Oath of due obedience to
the Archbiſhop.
N the Name of God, Amen. I, N. chosen Biƒhop of the Church
and See of N. doe p°ofe±e and p°omiƒe, a due reuerence and obedience
to the Archbiƒhop, and to the Metropoliticall Church of N.
and to their ƒucce±o°s: so helpe me God, th°ough Jeƒus Ch°i¥e.
This Oath shall not be made at the Conſecration of an Archbiſhop.
Then the Archbiſhop shall mooue the Congregation preſent, to praye, ſaying
thus to them.
Rethren, it is w°itten in the Goƒpel of S. Luke, that our Savioure
Ch°i¥ continued the whole night in prayer, o° euer that he did chuƒe and ƒend fo°th his tewlue Apo¥les. It is w°itten alƒo in
the Acts of the Apo¥les, that the Diƒciples which were at Antioche
did fa¥ and pray, o° euer they laid hands vpon, or ƒent fo°th Paul
and Barnabas. Let vs therefo°e, following the example of our
Saviour Ch°i¥ and his Apo¥les, fir¥ fall to p°ayer, o° that we
admit and send fo°th this perƒon p°eƒented vnto vs, to the wo°ke
wherunto we tru¥e the holy Gho¥ hath called him.
M
I
B 
And then ſhall be ſaid the Letanie, as afore in the order of Deacons,
And after this place: That it may pleaƒe the to illuminate all Bi- ƒhops. &c. he ſhal ſay.
That it may pleaƒe thee to ble±e this our b°other elected, and to
ƒend thy grace vpon him, that he may duely execute the office wherunto hee is called, to the edifying of thy Church, and to the
honour, p°aiƒe, and glory of thy Name.
 Aunswere.
We beseech thee to heare vs good Lo°d.
Concluding the Letanie in the end, with this prayer.
Lmightie God, giuer of all good things, which by thy holy ƒpi- rit ha¥ appointed divers orders of Mini¥ers in thy Church, mercifully behold this thy seruant, now called to the wo°ke and
mini¥ery of a Biƒhop, and repleniƒh him ƒo with the truth of thy
doctrine, and innocencie of life, that both by wo°d and deed he may faithfully serue thee in this office, to the glo°y of thy Name, and
profit of thy Congregation, through the merits of our Sauiour
Jeƒus Ch°i¥, who liueth and reigneth with thee and the holy Gho¥, wo°ld without end. Amen.

Then the Archbiſhop ſitting in a chaire, ſhall ſay to him that is to bee conſecrated.

Rother, fo° as much as holy Scripture, and the old Canons
commandeth, that we ƒhould not be ha¥y in laying on hands, and admitting of any perƒon to the gouernement of the Congregation
of Ch°i¥, which he hath purchaƒed with no le±e p°ice than the
effuƒion of his owne blood: afo°e I admit you to this admini¥ration
wherunto you are called, I will examine you in certaine articles, to
the end the Congregation present, may haue a triall and beare witne±e
how ye be minded to behaue your ƒelfe in the Church of God.
 Are you perƒwaded that you bee truly called to this mini¥ration
according to the will of our Lo°de Jeƒus Chri¥, and the o°der of
this Realme?
Anſwere.
I am ƒo perƒwaded.
The Archbiſhop.
Re you perƒwaded that the holy Scriptures containe ƒuffici- ently all doctrine, required of nece±itie fo° eternall ƒaluation, th°ough the faith in Jeƒus Ch°i¥? And are you determined with the
ƒame holy Scriptures, to in¥ruct the people committed to your
A
B
A
charge, and to teach o° maintaine nothing, as required of nece±itie
to eternall saluation, but that you ƒhall be perƒwaded may be concluded, and p°oued by the ƒame?
Anſwere.
I am so perƒwaded and determined by Gods grace.
The Archbiſhop.
Ill you then faithfully exerciƒe your ƒelfe in the ƒayd holy
Scriptures, and call vpon God by p°ayer fo° the true un- der¥anding of the ƒame, ƒo as ye may be able by them to teache and
exho°t with wholeƒome doctrine, and to with¥and and conuince the
gaineƒayers?
Anſwere.
I will so doe, by the helpe of God.
The Archbiſhop.
E you ready with all faithfull diligence to baniƒh and d°iue away
all erroneous and ¥range doctrine contrary to Gods wo°d, and both p°iuately and openly to call vpon, and encourage
other to the ƒame?
Anſwere.
I am ready, the Lo°d being my helper.
The Archbiſhop.
Ill you deny all vngodline±e and wo°ldly lu¥s, and liue
ƒoberly, righteously, and godly in this wo°ld, that you may ƒhewe your ƒelfe in all things an example of good wo°ks vnto other,
that the aduerƒary may be aƒhamed, hauing nothing to lay again¥
you?
Anſwere.
I will so doe, the Lo°d being my helper.
The Archbiſhop.
Ill you maintaine and ƒet fo°ward (as much as shall lie in
you) quietne±e, peace, and loue emonge all men: and ƒuch as be vnquiet, diƒobedient, and criminous within your Dioce±e, co°- rect and puniƒh, acco°ding to ƒuch autho°itie, as yee haue by Gods wo°d, and as to you shall bee committed, by the ordinance of this
Realme?
Anſwere.
I will doe ƒo by the helpe of God.
The Archbiſhop.
Ill you ƒhewe your ƒelfe gentle, and be mercifull fo° Ch°i¥s
ƒake to poo°e and needie people, and to all ¥rangers de¥itute
of helpe?
W
B
W
W
W
Anſwere.
I will ƒo ƒhewe myƒelfe by Gods helpe.
The Archbiſhop.
Lmightie God oure heauenly Father, who hath giuen you a good will to doe all theƒe things, grant alƒo vnto you, ¥rength and power to perfo°me the ƒame, that hee accompliƒhing in you, the
good wo°ke which he hath begon, yee may bee found perfect, and
irrep°ehenƒible at the latter day, th°ough Jeƒus Ch°i¥ our Lo°d.
Amen.
Then ſhall be ſung or ſaid, Come holy Gho, &c.
As it is ƒet out in the o°der of Prie¥s.
That ended, the Archbiſhop ſhall ſay.
Lo°de, heare our p°ayer.
Anſwer.
And let our cry come vnto thee.
 ¶ Let vs pray.
Lmighty God and mo¥ mercifull Father,
which of thine infinite goodne±e ha¥ giuen thy
onely and mo¥ deare beloued Son Jeƒus
Ch°i¥ to be our Redeemer and Autho° of
euerla¥ing life, who after that hee had made
perfect our Redemption by his death, and
was aƒcended into heauen, pow°ed downe his
gifts abondantly vpon men, making ƒome Apo¥les, some P°ophets, ƒome Euangeli¥s, ƒome Pa¥ours and
Doctours, to the edifying and making perfect his Congregation:
grant wee beƒeech thee, to this thy ƒervant ƒuch grace, that hee may
euermo°e be ready to ƒp°eade ab°oad thy Gospell, and glad tidings
of reconcilement to God, and to vƒe the autho°itie giuen vnto him,
not to de¥roy, but to ƒave, not to hurt, but to helpe: ƒo that he, as a
wiƒe and a faithfull ƒervant, giuing to thy family meate in due ƒea-
ƒon, may at the la¥ bee receiued into ioy, through Jeƒu Ch°i¥ our
Lo°d, who with thee, and the holy Gho¥ liueth and reigneth one
God, wo°ld without end. Amen.
Then the Archbiſhop and Biſhops preſent, ſhal lay their hands vpon the head of
the eleed Biſhop, the Archbiſhop ſaying.
Ake the holy Gho¥, and remember that thou ¥irre up the grace
of God, which is in thee, by impoƒicion of hands: fo° god hath not giuen vs the ƒpirite of feare, but of power, and loue, and ƒoberne±e.

A
T 
Then the Archbiſhop ſhal deliuer him the
Bible, ſaying.
Iue heed vnto reading, exho°tation and doctrine. Thinke vpon
theƒe things contained in this booke. Be diligent in them, that
the increaƒe comming thereby, may be manife¥ vnto all men. Take
heed vnto thyƒelfe, and vnto teaching, and be diligent in doing them:
fo° by doing this thou ƒhalt ƒaue thy ƒelfe, and them that heare thee. Bee to the flocke of Ch°i¥ a ƒhepherd, not a wolfe: feed them,
deuoure them not: hold vp the weak, heale the ƒick, binde together
the b°oken, b°ing againe the outca¥s, ƒeeke the lo¥. bee ƒo mercifull,
that yee be not too remi±e: ƒo mini¥er diƒcipline, that you fo°get not
mercy, that when the chiefe Shepherd ƒhall come, ye may receiue
the immarce±ible crowne of glo°y, th°ough Jeƒus Ch°i¥ our Lo°d.
Amen.
Then the Archbiſhop ſhall proceed to the Communion, with whom the new
conſecrated Biſhop, with other ſhall alſo communicate. And for the la
Colle immediatlye before the Benediion, ſhall be ſaid this Prayer.
O¥ merciful Father, we beƒeech thee, to ƒend down vpon this
thy ƒeruant, thy heauenly ble±ing, and ƒo endue him with thy holy Spirit, that he p°eaching thy wo°d, may not onely be earne¥
to rep°ooue, beƒeech, and rebuke, with all patience and doctrine, but
alƒo may bee, to ƒuch as beleeue, an wholƒome example in wo°d, in
conuersation, in loue, in faith, in cha¥itie, and puritie, that faithfully
fulfilling his courƒe, at the latter day hee may receiue the Crowne of righteouƒne±e, laid vp by the Lo°d the righteous Judge, who liueth and reigneth,
one God with the Father and holy Gho¥, wo°ld without end.
Amen.
