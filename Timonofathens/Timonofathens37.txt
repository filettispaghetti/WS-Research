HORTENSIUS
And mine, my lord.
Both
Varro's Servants	And ours, my lord.
PHILOTUS
All our bills.
TIMON
Knock me down with 'em: cleave me to the girdle.
Lucilius' Servant	Alas, my lord,-
TIMON
Cut my heart in sums.
TITUS
Mine, fifty talents.
TIMON
Tell out my blood.
Lucilius' Servant	Five thousand crowns, my lord.
TIMON
Five thousand drops pays that.
What yours?--and yours?
Varro's
First Servant
My lord,--
Varro's
Second Servant
My lord,--
TIMON
Tear me, take me, and the gods fall upon you!
Exit

HORTENSIUS
'Faith, I perceive our masters may throw their caps
at their money: these debts may well be called
desperate ones, for a madman owes 'em.
Exeunt

Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS

TIMON
They have e'en put my breath from me, the slaves.
Creditors? devils!
FLAVIUS
My dear lord,--
TIMON
What if it should be so?
FLAVIUS
My lord,--
TIMON
I'll have it so. My steward!
FLAVIUS
Here, my lord.
