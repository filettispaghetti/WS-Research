Enter two Servants of Varro, and the Servant of LUCIUS, meeting TITUS, HORTENSIUS, and other Servants of TIMON's creditors, waiting his coming out
Varro's
First Servant
Well met; good morrow, Titus and Hortensius.
TITUS
The like to you kind Varro.
HORTENSIUS
Lucius!
What, do we meet together?
Lucilius' Servant	Ay, and I think
One business does command us all; for mine Is money.
TITUS
So is theirs and ours.
Enter PHILOTUS

Lucilius' Servant	And Sir Philotus too!
PHILOTUS
Good day at once.
Lucilius' Servant	Welcome, good brother.
What do you think the hour?
PHILOTUS
Labouring for nine.
Lucilius' Servant	So much?
PHILOTUS
Is not my lord seen yet?
Lucilius' Servant	Not yet.
PHILOTUS
I wonder on't; he was wont to shine at seven.
Lucilius' Servant	Ay, but the days are wax'd shorter with him:
You must consider that a prodigal course
Is like the sun's; but not, like his, recoverable.
I fear 'tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;
That is one may reach deep enough, and yet
Find little.
PHILOTUS
I am of your fear for that.
TITUS
I'll show you how to observe a strange event.
Your lord sends now for money.
HORTENSIUS
Most true, he does.
TITUS
And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,
For which I wait for money.
HORTENSIUS
It is against my heart.
Lucilius' Servant	Mark, how strange it shows,
Timon in this should pay more than he owes:
And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels,
