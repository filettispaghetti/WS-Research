Les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant
leur noces, il n'est pas la coutume de France.
KING HENRY V
Madam my interpreter, what says she?
ALICE
Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of
France,--I cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish.
KING HENRY V
To kiss.
ALICE

country in denying me a kiss: therefore, patiently

petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.
Re-enter the FRENCH KING and his QUEEN, BURGUNDY, and other Lords

God save your majesty! my royal cousin, teach you
our princess English?
KING HENRY V

BURGUNDY
Is she not apt?
KING HENRY V

smooth; so that, having neither the voice nor the
heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up
the spirit of love in her, that he will appear in

BURGUNDY
