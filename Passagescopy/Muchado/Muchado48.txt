DOGBERRY
One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed
comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would
have them this morning examined before your worship.
LEONATO
Take their examination yourself and bring it me: I
am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.
DOGBERRY
It shall be suffigance.
LEONATO
Drink some wine ere you go: fare you well.
Enter a Messenger

Messenger
My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to
her husband.
LEONATO
I'll wait upon them: I am ready.
Exeunt LEONATO and Messenger

DOGBERRY
Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole;
bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we
are now to examination these men.
VERGES
And we must do it wisely.
DOGBERRY
We will spare for no wit, I warrant you; here's
that shall drive some of them to a non-come: only
get the learned writer to set down our
excommunication and meet me at the gaol.
Exeunt

You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.

To be married to her: friar, you come to marry her.
