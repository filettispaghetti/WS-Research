troubled with a rheum;
What willingly he did confound he wail'd,
Believe't, till I wept too.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
No, sweet Octavia,
You shall hear from me still; the time shall not
Out-go my thinking on you.
MARK ANTONY
Come, sir, come;
I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:
Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,
And give you to the gods.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Adieu; be happy!
LEPIDUS
Let all the number of the stars give light
To thy fair way!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Farewell, fa rewell!
Kisses OCTAVIA

MARK ANTONY
Farewell!
Trumpets sound. Exeunt

SCENE III. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS
CLEOPATRA
Where is the fellow?
ALEXAS
Half afeard to come.
CLEOPATRA
Go to, go to.
Enter the Messenger as before

Come hither, sir.
ALEXAS
Good majesty,
Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
But when you are well pleased.
CLEOPATRA
That Herod's head
I'll have: but how, when Antony is gone
Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.
Messenger
Most gracious majesty,--
CLEOPATRA
Didst thou behold Octavia?
Messenger
