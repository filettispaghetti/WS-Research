I'll give thee, friend,
An armour all of gold; it was a king's.
MARK ANTONY
He has deserved it, were it carbuncled
Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:
Through Alexandria make a jolly march;
Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them:
Had our great palace the capacity
To camp this host, we all would sup together,
And drink carouses to the next day's fate,
Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,
With brazen din blast you the city's ear;
Make mingle with rattling tabourines;
That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,
Applauding our approach.
Exeunt

SCENE IX. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.

Sentinels at their post
First Soldier
If we be not relieved within this hour,
We must return to the court of guard: the night
Is shiny; and they say we shall embattle
By the second hour i' the morn.
Second Soldier
This last day was
A shrewd one to's.
Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
O, bear me witness, night,--
Third Soldier
What man is this?
Second Soldier
Stand close, and list him.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,
When men revolted shall upon record
Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did
Before thy face repent!
First Soldier
Enobarbus!
Third Soldier
Peace!
Hark further.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,
That life, a very rebel to my will,
