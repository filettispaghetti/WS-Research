And not without men's pity. To live still,
Have their good wishes; we prevent
The loathsome misery of age, beguile
The gout and rheum that in lag hours attend
For gray approachers; we come towards the gods
Young and unwappered, not halting under crimes
Many and stale. That sure shall please the gods
Sooner than such, to give us nectar with 'em,
For we are more clear spirits. My dear kinsmen,
Whose lives for this poor comfort are laid down,
You have sold 'em too too cheap.

FIRST KNIGHT  What ending could be
Of more content? O'er us the victors have
Fortune, whose title is as momentary
As to us death is certain. A grain of honor
They not o'er-weigh us.

SECOND KNIGHT  Let us bid farewell;
And with our patience anger tott'ring Fortune,
Who at her certain'st reels.

THIRD KNIGHT  Come, who begins?

PALAMON
E'en he that led you to this banquet shall
Taste to you all. [To Jailer.] Ah ha, my friend, my
friend,
Your gentle daughter gave me freedom once;
You'll see 't done now forever. Pray, how does she?
I heard she was not well; her kind of ill
Gave me some sorrow.

JAILER  Sir, she's well restored,
And to be married shortly.

PALAMON  By my short life,
I am most glad on 't. 'Tis the latest thing
I shall be glad of; prithee, tell her so.
Commend me to her, and to piece her portion,
Tender her this.	[He gives his purse to Jailer.]

FIRST KNIGHT  Nay, let's be offerers all.

SECOND KNIGHT
Is it a maid?

PALAMON  Verily, I think so.
A right good creature, more to me deserving
Than I can quit or speak of.
