
PALAMON  O you heavens, dares any
So noble bear a guilty business? None
But only Arcite. Therefore none but Arcite
In this kind is so bold.

ARCITE  Sweet Palamon.

PALAMON
I do embrace you and your offer; for
Your offer do 't I only. Sir, your person
Without hypocrisy I may not wish
More than my sword's edge on 't.
[Wind horns off; sound cornets.]

ARCITE  You hear the horns.
Enter your muset, lest this match between 's
Be crossed ere met. Give me your hand; farewell.
I'll bring you every needful thing. I pray you,
Take comfort and be strong.

PALAMON  Pray hold your promise,
And do the deed with a bent brow. Most certain
You love me not; be rough with me, and pour
This oil out of your language. By this air,
I could for each word give a cuff, my stomach
Not reconciled by reason.

ARCITE  Plainly spoken,
Yet pardon me hard language. When I spur
My horse, I chide him not; content and anger
In me have but one face.	[Wind horns.]
Hark, sir, they call
The scattered to the banquet; you must guess
I have an office there.

PALAMON  Sir, your attendance
Cannot please heaven, and I know your office
Unjustly is achieved.

ARCITE  'Tis a good title.
I am persuaded this question, sick between 's,
By bleeding must be cured. I am a suitor
That to your sword you will bequeath this plea,
And talk of it no more.

PALAMON  But this one word:
You are going now to gaze upon my mistress,
For note you, mine she is--
