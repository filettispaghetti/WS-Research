	And I'll go seek him through the world that is so
wide.
	   Hey nonny, nonny, nonny.
O, for a prick now, like a nightingale,
To put my breast against. I shall sleep like a top else.
[She exits.]

Scene 5
=======
[Enter a Schoolmaster and six Countrymen,
one dressed as a Bavian.]


SCHOOLMASTER  Fie, fie, what tediosity and disinsanity
is here among you! Have my rudiments been labored
so long with you, milked unto you, and, by a
figure, even the very plum broth and marrow of
my understanding laid upon you, and do you still
cry "Where?" and "How?" and "Wherefore?" You
most coarse-frieze capacities, you jean judgments,
have I said "Thus let be" and "There let be"
and "Then let be" and no man understand me? Proh
deum, medius fidius, you are all dunces! Forwhy,
here stand I; here the Duke comes; there are you,
close in the thicket; the Duke appears; I meet him
and unto him I utter learned things and many figures;
he hears, and nods, and hums, and then cries
"Rare!" and I go forward. At length I fling my cap
up--mark there! Then do you as once did Meleager
and the boar--break comely out before him;
like true lovers, cast yourselves in a body decently,
and sweetly, by a figure, trace and turn, boys.

FIRST COUNTRYMAN  And sweetly we will do it, Master
Gerald.

SECOND COUNTRYMAN  Draw up the company. Where's
the taborer?

THIRD COUNTRYMAN  Why, Timothy!

[Enter the Taborer.]


TABORER  Here, my mad boys. Have at you!

SCHOOLMASTER  But I say, where's their women?

[Enter five Wenches.]
