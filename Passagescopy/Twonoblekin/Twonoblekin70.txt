JAILER  'Tis true.

DAUGHTER  Good e'en, good men. Pray, did you ever
hear of one young Palamon?

JAILER  Yes, wench, we know him.

DAUGHTER  Is 't not a fine young gentleman?

JAILER  'Tis, love.

BROTHER, [aside to others]  By no mean cross her; she
is then distempered far worse than now she
shows.

FIRST FRIEND, [to Daughter]  Yes, he's a fine man.

DAUGHTER  O , is he so? You have a sister.

FIRST FRIEND  Yes.

DAUGHTER  But she shall never have him--tell her so--
for a trick that I know; you'd best look to her, for
if she see him once, she's gone, she's done and
undone in an hour. All the young maids of our
town are in love with him, but I laugh at 'em and
let 'em all alone. Is 't not a wise course?

FIRST FRIEND  Yes.

DAUGHTER  There is at least two hundred now with
child by him--there must be four; yet I keep close
for all this, close as a cockle; and all these must be
boys--he has the trick on 't--and at ten years old
they must be all gelt for musicians and sing the
wars of Theseus.

SECOND FRIEND  This is strange.

DAUGHTER  As ever you heard, but say nothing.

FIRST FRIEND  No.

DAUGHTER  They come from all parts of the dukedom
to him; I'll warrant you, he had not so few last
night as twenty to dispatch. He'll tickle 't up in two
hours, if his hand be in.

JAILER, [aside]  She's lost past all cure.
