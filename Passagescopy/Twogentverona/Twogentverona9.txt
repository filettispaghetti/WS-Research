JULIA
And is that paper nothing?
LUCETTA
Nothing concerning me.
JULIA
Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
LUCETTA
Madam, it will not lie where it concerns
Unless it have a false interpeter.
JULIA
Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
LUCETTA
That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
Give me a note: your ladyship can set.
JULIA
As little by such toys as may be possible.
Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.'
LUCETTA
It is too heavy for so light a tune.
JULIA
Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?
LUCETTA
Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it.
JULIA
And why not you?
LUCETTA
I cannot reach so high.
JULIA
Let's see your song. How now, minion!
LUCETTA
Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:
And yet methinks I do not like this tune.
JULIA
You do not?
LUCETTA
No, madam; it is too sharp.
JULIA
You, minion, are too saucy.
LUCETTA
Nay, now you are too flat
And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:
There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.
JULIA
The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
LUCETTA
Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
JULIA
This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
Here is a coil with protestation!
Tears the letter
