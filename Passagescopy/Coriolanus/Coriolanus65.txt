Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, and COMINIUS, with Senators and Patricians

MENENIUS
Calmly, I do beseech you.
CORIOLANUS
Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece
Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods
Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice
Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!
Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,
And not our streets with war!
First Senator
Amen, amen.
MENENIUS
A noble wish.
Re-enter AEdile, with Citizens

SICINIUS
Draw near, ye people.
AEdile
List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!
CORIOLANUS
First, hear me speak.
Both Tribunes
Well, say. Peace, ho!
CORIOLANUS
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?
SICINIUS
I do demand,
If you submit you to the people's voices,
Allow their officers and are content
To suffer lawful censure for such faults
As shall be proved upon you?
CORIOLANUS
I am content.
MENENIUS
Lo, citizens, he says he is content:
The warlike service he has done, consider; think
Upon the wounds his body bears, which show
Like graves i' the holy churchyard.
CORIOLANUS
Scratches with briers,
Scars to move laughter only.
MENENIUS
Consider further,
That when he speaks not like a citizen,
You find him like a soldier: do not take
His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
But, as I say, such as become a soldier,
