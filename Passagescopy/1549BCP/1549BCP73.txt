I will offer to thee the ƒacrifice of thankes geuyng, and will
call vpon the name of the Lo°de.
I will pay my vowes vnto the lo°de, in the ƒyghte of all his
people, in the courtes of the lo°des houƒe, euen in the midde¥
of thee, O Hieruƒalem.
Glo°ie to the father, &c.

yƒe the lo°de, (o my ƒoule), while I liue wil I p°ayƒe
e lo°de : yea, as long as I haue any being, I wil ƒing
p°ayƒes vnto my god.
O put not your tru¥ in p°inces, no° in any childe of man,
fo° there is no helpe in them.
Fo° when the b°eath of man goeth furth, he ƒhall turne
agayn to his yearth, and then all his thoughtes periƒh.
Ble±ed is he that hath the God of Jacob fo° hys helpe : and
whoƒe hope is in the lo°de hys god.
Which made heauen and earth, the ƒea, and al that therein
is: whiche kepeth his p°omiƒe fo° euer.
Whiche helpeth them to right that ƒuffer w°ong, which
feedeth the hungrie.
The lo°de looceth men out of p°ieƒon, the lo°de geueth ƒight to
the blynde.
The lo°de helpeth them vp that are fallen, the lo°de careth
fo° the righteous.
The lo°d careth fo° the ¥raungers, he defendeth the fatherle±e
and widdowe : as fo° the waye of the vngodly, he turneth
it vpƒyde downe.
The lo°de thy God, O Sion, ƒhalbe kyng fo° euermo°e, and
throughout all generacions. 
At the Burial.
Glo°y to the father, &c.

Lo°d, thou ha¥ ƒearched me out, and knowen me.
Thou knowe¥ my downƒitting, and mine vpriƒing :
thou vnder¥ande¥ my thoughtes long befo°e.
Thou art about my pathe, and about my bed, and ƒpie¥ out
al my waies.
Domine, probai.
