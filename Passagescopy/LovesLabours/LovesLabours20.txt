'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.
BIRON
Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.
ROSALINE
Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
BIRON
What time o' day?
ROSALINE
The hour that fools should ask.
BIRON
Now fair befall your mask!
ROSALINE
Fair fall the face it covers!
BIRON
And send you many lovers!
ROSALINE
Amen, so you be none.
BIRON
Nay, then will I be gone.
FERDINAND
Madam, your father here doth intimate
The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
Being but the one half of an entire sum
Disbursed by my father in his wars.
But say that he or we, as neither have,
Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,
One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
Although not valued to the money's worth.
If then the king your father will restore
But that one half which is unsatisfied,
We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
But that, it seems, he little purposeth,
For here he doth demand to have repaid
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
To have his title live in Aquitaine;
Which we much rather had depart withal
And have the money by our father lent
Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast
And go well satisfied to France again.
PRINCESS
You do the king my father too much wrong
And wrong the reputation of your name,
In so unseeming to confess receipt
Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
