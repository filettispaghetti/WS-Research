FIRST MURDERER  Stand to 't.

BANQUO, [to Fleance]  It will be rain tonight.

THIRD MURDERER
Who did strike out the light?

FIRST MURDERER  Was 't not the way?

THIRD MURDERER  There's but one down. The son is
fled.

SECOND MURDERER  We have lost best half of our
affair.

FIRST MURDERER
Well, let's away and say how much is done.
[They exit.]
