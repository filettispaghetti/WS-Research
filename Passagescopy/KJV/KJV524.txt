John 2:6	And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.
John 2:7	Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
John 2:8	And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.
John 2:9	When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
John 2:10	And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.
John 2:11	This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
John 2:12	After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.
John 2:13	And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
John 2:14	And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:
John 2:15	And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;
John 2:16	And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.
John 2:17	And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.
John 2:18	Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?
John 2:19	Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
John 2:20	Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?
John 2:21	But he spake of the temple of his body.
John 2:22	When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
John 2:23	Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.
John 2:24	But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,
John 2:25	And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.
John 3:1	There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
John 3:2	The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.
John 3:3	Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
John 3:4	Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?
John 3:5	Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
John 3:6	That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
John 3:7	Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
John 3:8	The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
John 3:9	Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
John 3:10	Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?
John 3:11	Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.
John 3:12	If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?
John 3:13	And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.
John 3:14	And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:
John 3:15	That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
John 3:16	For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
John 3:17	For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
John 3:18	He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
John 3:19	And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
John 3:20	For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
John 3:21	But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.
John 3:22	After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.
John 3:23	And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
John 3:24	For John was not yet cast into prison.
John 3:25	Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.
John 3:26	And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.
John 3:27	John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.
John 3:28	Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
John 3:29	He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.
John 3:30	He must increase, but I must decrease.
