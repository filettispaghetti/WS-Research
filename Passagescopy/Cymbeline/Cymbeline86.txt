light, the purse too light, being drawn of
heaviness: of this contradiction you shall now be
quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up
thousands in a trice: you have no true debitor and
creditor but it; of what's past, is, and to come,
the discharge: your neck, sir, is pen, book and

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
I am merrier to die than thou art to live.

Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and Messenger

First Gaoler
