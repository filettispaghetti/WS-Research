Clown
Are you ready, sir?
DUKE ORSINO
Ay; prithee, sing.
Music

SONG.
Clown
Come away, come away, death,
And in sad cypress let me be laid;
Fly away, fly away breath;
I am slain by a fair cruel maid.
My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,
O, prepare it!
My part of death, no one so true
Did share it.
Not a flower, not a flower sweet
On my black coffin let there be strown;
Not a friend, not a friend greet
My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown:
A thousand thousand sighs to save,
Lay me, O, where
Sad true lover never find my grave,
To weep there!
DUKE ORSINO
There's for thy pains.
Clown
No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.
DUKE ORSINO
I'll pay thy pleasure then.
Clown
Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.
DUKE ORSINO
Give me now leave to leave thee.
Clown
Now, the melancholy god protect thee; and the
tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for
thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such
constancy put to sea, that their business might be
every thing and their intent every where; for that's
it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.
Exit

DUKE ORSINO
Let all the rest give place.
CURIO and Attendants retire

Once more, Cesario,
Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:
Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,
