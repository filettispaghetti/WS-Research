power. It i# sowen a natural body, it riseth againe a spirituall
body. There i# a natural body, and there i# a spirituall body :
a# it i# also written, The first man Adam wa# made a liuing
soule, and the last Adam wa# made a quickening spirite. Howbeit
that i# not first which i# spirituall, but that which i# natureall
and then that which i# spirituall. The first man i# of
the earth, earthy. The second man i# the Lord from heauen,
heauenly. A# i# the earthy, such are they that be earthy. And
a# i# the heauenly, such are they that are heauenly. And a# we
haue borne the image of the earthy, so shall we beare the 
image of the heauenly. Thi# say I, brethren, that flesh and
blood cannot inherite the Kingdome of God, neither doth
corruption inherite incorruption. Behold, I shew you a mystery.
We shall not all sleepe : but we shall all be changed, and
that in a moment, in the twinckling of an eye, by the last
trumpe. For the trumpe shall blow, and the deade shall rise incorruptible,
and we shall be changed. For thi# corruptible must
put on incorruption, and thi# mortall must put on immortality.
When thi# corruptible hath put on incorruption, and thi# mortall
hath put on immortality, then shall be brought to passe the
saying that i# written : Death i# swallowed vp in victory :
Death, where i# thy sting? Hell, where i# thy victory? The
sting of death i# sinne, and the strength of sinne i# the Law.
But thanke# be vnto God, which hath giuen v# victory
through our Lord Jesu# Christ. Therfore my deare brethren,
be yee stedfast and vnmouable, alwaye# rich in the worke of
the Lord, forasmuch a# yee know how that your labour i# not
in vaine in the Lord.
¶ The Leon ended, the Prie all ſay.
Lord haue mercie vpon v#.
 Christe haue mercie vpon v#.
Lord haue mercie vpon v#.
 ¶ Our Father which art in heauen. &c.
And leade v# not into temptation.

But deliuer v# from euill. Amen.

Lmightie God, with whom doe liue the spirit#
of them that depart hence in the Lord,
and in whom the soule# of them that be elected,
after they be deliuered from the burden
of the flesh, be in ioy and felicitie : Wee giue
thee heartie thanke# for that it hath pleased
thee to deliuer thi# N. our brother, out of
the miserie# of thi# sinfull world beseeching thee, that it may
please thee of thy graciou# goodnesse, shortly to accomplish the
numbre of thine elect, and to hasten thy Kingdome, that wee
with thi# our brother, and all other departed in the true faith 
of thy holy Name, may haue our perfect consummation and
blisse, both in body and soule in thy eternall and euerlasting
