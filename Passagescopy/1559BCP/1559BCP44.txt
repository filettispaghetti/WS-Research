Who wa# present when the childe wa# baptized?
And because something# essentiall to thi# Sacrament may
happen to bee omitted through feare or haste in such time# of
extremitie; therefore I demand further of you;
With what matter wa# the childe baptized?
With what word# wa# the childe baptized?
Whether think you the childe to bee lawfully and perfectly
baptized? 
¶ And if the Minier all finde by the anſwers of ſuch as bring the childe,
that all things were done as they ought to bee: then hal not hee
Chrien the childe againe, but all receiue him as one of the flocke of
the true Chriian people, ſaying thus,
Certifie you, that in thi# case all i# well done, and according
vnto due order concerning the baptizing of
thi# childe, which being borne in originall sinne and
in the wrath of God, i# nowe by the lauer of regeneration
in Baptisme, receiued into the number of the children of
God, and heire# of euerlasting life: for our Lord Jesu# Christ
doeth not deny hi# grace and mercy vnto such ‘Infant#, but
most louingly doth call the vnto him: a# the holy gospel doth
witnesse to our comfort on thi# wise.
T a certaine time they brought children vnto Christ
that he should touch them: and hi# Disciple# rebuked
those that brought them. But when Jesu# saw it, he
wa# displeased, and said vnto them: Suffer little
children to come vnto me, and forbid them not, for to such belongeth
the Kingdome of God. Verely I say vnto you, whosoeuer
doth not receiue the Kingdome of God a# a little childe,
hee shall not enter therin. And when he had taken them vp in
his arme#, he put hi# hand# vpon them, and blessed them.
Marke 10.
¶ After the Goſpel is read, the minier al make this exhortation vpon the
words of the Goſpel.
Riend#, you heare in thi# Gospel the word# of our
Sauiour Christe, that he commanded the chyldren
to be brought vnto him: how he blamed those that
would haue kepte them from him, how hee exhorted
all men to follow their innocencie: Yee
perceiue how by hi# outward gesture and deed he declared hi#
good will toward them. For he embraced them in hi# arme#,
he laid hi# hand# vpon them, and blessed them, Doubt ye not
therefore, but earnestly beleeue, that he hath likewise fauourably
receiued thi# present Infant, that hee hath embraced him
with the arme# of hi# mercie, that he hath giuen vnto him the
blessing of eternall life, and made him partaker of hi# euerlasting
Kingdome. Wherfore wee beeing thu# perswaded of the
good will of our heauenly Father, declared by hi# Sonne
Jesu# Christ toward# thi# Infant, Let v# faithfully and de-
voutly giue thanke# vnto him, and say the prayer, which the
Lord himselfe taught, and in declaration of our Faith, let v#
