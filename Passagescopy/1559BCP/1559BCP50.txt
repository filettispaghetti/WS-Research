Ur Father which art in heauen, Hallowed be thy
Name. Thy Kingdome come. Thy will be done

I desire my Lord God our heauenly Father, who i# the

all thing# that be needfull both for our soule# and bodie#. and
that hee will be mercifull vnto v#, and forgiue v# our sinne#,
and that it will please him to saue and defend v# in all danger#
ghostly and bodily, and that he will keepe v# from all
sinne and wickednesse, and from our ghostly enemie, and from
euerlastyng death. And this I trust he wil doe of hi# mercy and
goodnesse, through our Lord Jesu# Christ. And therefore I
say. Amen. So be it.
