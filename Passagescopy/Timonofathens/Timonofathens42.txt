I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how all
things go.
Second Lord
Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed of
you?
First Lord
A thousand pieces.
Second Lord
A thousand pieces!
First Lord
What of you?
Second Lord
He sent to me, sir,--Here he comes.
Enter TIMON and Attendants

TIMON
With all my heart, gentlemen both; and how fare you?
First Lord
Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.
Second Lord
The swallow follows not summer more willing than we
your lordship.
TIMON
[Aside] Nor more willingly leaves winter; such
summer-birds are men. Gentlemen, our dinner will not
recompense this long stay: feast your ears with the
music awhile, if they will fare so harshly o' the
trumpet's sound; we shall to 't presently.
First Lord
I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship
that I returned you an empty messenger.
TIMON
O, sir, let it not trouble you.
Second Lord
My noble lord,--
TIMON
Ah, my good friend, what cheer?
Second Lord
My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame,
that, when your lordship this other day sent to me,
I was so unfortunate a beggar.
TIMON
Think not on 't, sir.
Second Lord
If you had sent but two hours before,--
TIMON
Let it not cumber your better remembrance.
The banquet brought in

Come, bring in all together.
