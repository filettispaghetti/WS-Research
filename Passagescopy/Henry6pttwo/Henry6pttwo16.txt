Did never traitor in the land commit.
SUFFOLK
Peace, headstrong Warwick!
WARWICK
Image of pride, why should I hold my peace?
Enter HORNER, the Armourer, and his man PETER, guarded

SUFFOLK
Because here is a man accused of treason:
Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself!
YORK
Doth any one accuse York for a traitor?
KING HENRY VI
What mean'st thou, Suffolk; tell me, what are these?
SUFFOLK
Please it your majesty, this is the man
That doth accuse his master of high treason:
His words were these: that Richard, Duke of York,
Was rightful heir unto the English crown
And that your majesty was a usurper.
KING HENRY VI
Say, man, were these thy words?
HORNER
An't shall please your majesty, I never said nor
thought any such matter: God is my witness, I am
falsely accused by the villain.
PETER
By these ten bones, my lords, he did speak them to
me in the garret one night, as we were scouring my
Lord of York's armour.
YORK
Base dunghill villain and mechanical,
I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech.
I do beseech your royal majesty,
Let him have all the rigor of the law.
HORNER
Alas, my lord, hang me, if ever I spake the words.
My accuser is my 'prentice; and when I did correct
him for his fault the other day, he did vow upon his
knees he would be even with me: I have good
witness of this: therefore I beseech your majesty,
do not cast away an honest man for a villain's
accusation.
KING HENRY VI
Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?
GLOUCESTER
This doom, my lord, if I may judge:
Let Somerset be regent over the French,
Because in York this breeds suspicion:
And let these have a day appointed them
