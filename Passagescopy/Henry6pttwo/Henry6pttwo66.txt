CADE
They fell before thee like sheep and oxen, and thou
behavedst thyself as if thou hadst been in thine own
slaughter-house: therefore thus will I reward thee,
the Lent shall be as long again as it is; and thou
shalt have a licence to kill for a hundred lacking
one.
DICK
I desire no more.
CADE
And, to speak truth, thou deservest no less. This
monument of the victory will I bear;
Putting on SIR HUMPHREY'S brigandine

and the bodies shall be dragged at my horse' heels
till I do come to London, where we will have the
mayor's sword borne before us.
DICK
If we mean to thrive and do good, break open the
gaols and let out the prisoners.
CADE
Fear not that, I warrant thee. Come, let's march
towards London.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. London. The palace.

Enter KING HENRY VI with a supplication, and the QUEEN with SUFFOLK'S head, BUCKINGHAM and Lord SAY
QUEEN MARGARET
Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind,
And makes it fearful and degenerate;
Think therefore on revenge and cease to weep.
But who can cease to weep and look on this?
Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast:
But where's the body that I should embrace?
BUCKINGHAM
What answer makes your grace to the rebels'
supplication?
KING HENRY VI
I'll send some holy bishop to entreat;
For God forbid so many simple souls
Should perish by the sword! And I myself,
Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,
Will parley with Jack Cade their general:
But stay, I'll read it over once again.
QUEEN MARGARET
Ah, barbarous villains! hath this lovely face
Ruled, like a wandering planet, over me,
And could it not enforce them to relent,
That were unworthy to behold the same?
