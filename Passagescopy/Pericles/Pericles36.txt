First Servant
So; lift there.
CERIMON
What is that?
First Servant
Sir, even now
Did the sea toss upon our shore this chest:
'Tis of some wreck.
CERIMON
Set 't down, let's look upon't.
Second Gentleman
'Tis like a coffin, sir.
CERIMON
Whate'er it be,
'Tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight:
If the sea's stomach be o'ercharged with gold,
'Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us.
Second Gentleman
'Tis so, my lord.
CERIMON
How close 'tis caulk'd and bitumed!
Did the sea cast it up?
First Servant
I never saw so huge a billow, sir,
As toss'd it upon shore.
CERIMON
Wrench it open;
Soft! it smells most sweetly in my sense.
Second Gentleman
A delicate odour.
CERIMON
As ever hit my nostril. So, up with it.
O you most potent gods! what's here? a corse!
First Gentleman
Most strange!
CERIMON
Shrouded in cloth of state; balm'd and entreasured
With full bags of spices! A passport too!
Apollo, perfect me in the characters!
Reads from a scroll

'Here I give to understand,
If e'er this coffin drive a-land,
I, King Pericles, have lost
This queen, worth all our mundane cost.
Who finds her, give her burying;
She was the daughter of a king:
Besides this treasure for a fee,
The gods requite his charity!'
If thou livest, Pericles, thou hast a heart
