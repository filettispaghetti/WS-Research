A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,
And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.
The epitaph is for Marina writ
By wicked Dionyza.
Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument

'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,
Who wither'd in her spring of year.
She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,
On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;
Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,
Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:
Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,
Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:
Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,
Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'
No visor does become black villany
So well as soft and tender flattery.
Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,
And bear his courses to be ordered
By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play
His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day
In her unholy service. Patience, then,
And think you now are all in Mytilene.

Did you ever hear the like?
Second Gentleman

being once gone.
First Gentleman
But to have divinity preached there! did you ever
dream of such a thing?
Second Gentleman
No, no. Come, I am for no more bawdy-houses:
shall's go hear the vestals sing?
First Gentleman
I'll do any thing now that is virtuous; but I
am out of the road of rutting for ever.
Exeunt

SCENE VI. The same. A room in the brothel.

Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULT
Pandar
Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her she
