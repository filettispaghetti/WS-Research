ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
And did not I in rage depart from thence?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
In verity you did; my bones bear witness,
That since have felt the vigour of his rage.
ADRIANA
Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?
PINCH
It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,
And yielding to him humours well his frenzy.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
ADRIANA
Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;
But surely master, not a rag of money.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?
ADRIANA
He came to me and I deliver'd it.
LUCIANA
And I am witness with her that she did.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
God and the rope-maker bear me witness
That I was sent for nothing but a rope!
PINCH
Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;
I know it by their pale and deadly looks:
They must be bound and laid in some dark room.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?
ADRIANA
I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
And, gentle master, I received no gold;
But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.
ADRIANA
Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;
And art confederate with a damned pack
To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:
