Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,
On purpose shut the doors against his way.
My way is now to hie home to his house,
And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
He rush'd into my house and took perforce
My ring away. This course I fittest choose;
For forty ducats is too much to lose.
Exit

SCENE IV. A street.

Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and the Officer
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
Fear me not, man; I will not break away:
I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,
To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
And will not lightly trust the messenger
That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,
I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears.
Enter DROMIO of Ephesus with a rope's-end

Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.
How now, sir! have you that I sent you for?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
But where's the money?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I returned.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
Beating him

Officer
Good sir, be patient.
