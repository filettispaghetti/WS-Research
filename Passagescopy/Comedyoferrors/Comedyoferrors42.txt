But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes
That would behold in me this shameful sport.
Enter three or four, and offer to bind him. He strives

ADRIANA
O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me.
PINCH
More company! The fiend is strong within him.
LUCIANA
Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them
To make a rescue?
Officer
Masters, let him go
He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.
PINCH
Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.
They offer to bind Dromio of Ephesus

ADRIANA
What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
Do outrage and displeasure to himself?
Officer
He is my prisoner: if I let him go,
The debt he owes will be required of me.
ADRIANA
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,
And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
Good master doctor, see him safe convey'd
Home to my house. O most unhappy day!
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
O most unhappy strumpet!
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Master, I am here entered in bond for you.
ANTIPHOLUS
OF EPHESUS
Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good master:
cry 'The devil!'
LUCIANA
God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!
ADRIANA
Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.
