TO THE RIGHT VVORSHIPFVL AND HIS speciall good maister, mayster Grego∣ry Cromwell, some to the ryght ho∣norable lorde Cromwell lorde priuie seale, Dauid Clapam sendeth gretynge.

THE VEHEMENT affectiō that I haue to you, impellyth me often tymes to deuise with my selfe what plesure or ser∣uice my symplenesse myght do, ac∣ceptable vnto your moste gentylle goodnes. But whan I consydred my small abilitie and your greate diligence towarde wysedome & ex∣cellent good qualities, that apper∣teyne to your astate, I was in ma∣ner cleane discoraged to attempte any thynge to presente vnto your maistershyp. Neuerthelesse whan
Page  [unnumbered]
I agayne remembred your greate goodnesse, and mooste gentyll fa∣mylyarytie shewed to me in youre yonge age, whiche by outewarde sygnes appereth stablysshed nowe in your moste gentyll harte, I am encouraged to wryte some thyng, to be a testimony of the loue & affe∣ction that I beare vnto you. And amonge many other I choase out to translate this lytel treatise, The commendation of Matrimonye, that you beinge coupled in mary∣age to so noble, so good, and soo vertuous a lady, & leadynge your lyues in suche honeste and chaste wyse (whyche thynge ouer manye nowe adayes neglecte, lyttell re∣gardyng this holy and honorable sacrament) maye clerely perceyue your selues in the same greately commended and praysed. And o∣ther,
Page  [unnumbered]
that haue not this holy band of wedlocke in so great veneratiō and honoure, as you haue, shall take occasion, partely at your ex∣ample, and partely of this Decla∣mation, to repent, that they haue transgressed ageynst so hyghe and so holy a sacrament, to the greate ieoperdy of theyr soules. For the apostell sayth: God shall iuge for∣nicatours * and aduouterers. And, The brekers of wedlocke shall not * inheryte the kyngedome of god. Wherfore I thought that this lyt∣tell queire shulde do moche good, to perswade suche as are wedlocke breakers, to leade their lyues ver∣tuously within the bondes of this holy sacrament, accordynge to the apostels saying: Let wedlocke be * kept honorable in al poyntes, and let the chamber be vndefyled. And
Page  [unnumbered]
as I supposed, that this treatyse set forth in englyshe wold do moch good, with the witty argumentes, quycke reasons, and weighty au∣thorities therin conteyned: So I verily thynke, it shall no lesse far∣ther, to dedycate the same to you, that are a very true patrone of ho∣nest life in wedlock. Wherto shuld I speake of your vertuous educa∣tiō, for the which your right hono∣rable father my good lord, hath be very diligent? And surely his care in that behalfe hath not ben onely for you, but for manye other: yea the thing that he specially wisheth and desyreth is, that the youthe of this hole realme of Englād shulde be brought vp vertuousely, name∣ly the noble mens chyldrē, in good litterature, & the other after theyr abilities, wyttes, and aptenes, in
Page  [unnumbered]
sciences and craftes, wherby they shall highly profite them selues, to the great aduancement of the com¦mon weale, and aboue al thinges, he wolde, that with theyr lernyng of good letters, sciences, and craf∣tes, they shuld be ernestly taught, obedyence to god, to the kynges hyghnesse, and to suche rulers and lawes, as his maiesty shal ordeyn. In whiche good mynde, that he beareth to the common welth almyghty god longe pre∣serue hym, and sende you bothe moche welthe and pros∣perytie.

Amen.

❧ THE PRAYSE of matrimony.

THE SACRA∣ment* of matrimo∣ny, being most an∣cient, and fyrst af∣ter that man was made, euen at the begynnynge of all thynges, was ordeyned and commanded of god, and was honowred, and hadde al∣wayes in hyghe veneration and reuerence, with people of all nati∣ons, sanctified and halowed with religion, establyshed by lawes, ad∣urned with miracles and wōders. The whiche sacrament trewely is more excellente, then other myste∣ries and lawes, in that it was or∣deyned before them, ordeyned I say, not of the imagination and in¦uention
Page  [unnumbered]
of men, but of god, prynce of all, euen from the fyrste begyn∣nynge of the worlde, before any synne, in the tyme of innocency, for the lauful offyce and propagation of mankynde. All other preceptes, commaundementes, and myste∣ries, that after the fal of man cam forth for the reparation, safegard, remedy, correction, and punisshe∣ment, were scasely admytted of a fewe, when this sacrament of ma∣trimony, through all partes of the worlde, and by the consente of all men, was receiued and taken. And farther it was no lesse strengthned and maynteyned with the power of god, then it was by his good∣nes and wysedome ordeyned. For god the maker of al thynges, wold this most holy bonde so to be knit with indissoluble glewe, and perse¦uer,
Page  [unnumbered]
that the husbande in his wife, and the wife in her husband, shuld alwayes bothe lyue and abyde, as a bone of bones, & fleshe of fleshe. For this was the fyrst commaun∣dement of god, institutynge ma∣trimony: The man shall forsake * his father and mother, and shall cleaue vnto his wife, and they shal be two in oone flesshe. Whiche thynge we rede not only in the old testamente, but the selfe same is confyrmed in the gospell, that by no diuersitie of maners, by no sa∣cietie or lothsomnes, not for age, barennes, or syckenes, nor for pe∣stilence, lepry, or any other conta∣giouse disease, and briefely for no cryme of heresy, nor by any mans power, that sacrament at any time ought to be broken. When Christ commaundeth, that whom the al∣myghtye
Page  [unnumbered]
power of god hath ones * ioyned together, noo power shall presume to separate. Nor it can be laufull for any cause, the wyfe to forsake her husbonde, or the hus∣bande his wyfe, bycause it is lau∣full for no manne to departe from him selfe, nor no man to leaue him selfe. For she whiche is made of a mannes rybbe, of flesshe, the same fleshe, and the same bone of bones for an helpe vnto the man: God neuer wold her to be seperate from the man, but for fornication: whi∣che one onely cause, God dyd ex∣cepte. But if for any other cause the stronge bonde, and vnytie of matrimony be loused, yet the per∣sones beinge separate, be and re∣mayne manne and wyfe, nor they with whom they be coupled after theyr deuorse, can be excused from
Page  [unnumbered]
aduoutry. And therfore Christ ad∣deth, sayinge: He that after his * wife is dimissed for aduoutry, ma∣ryeth an other woman, commyt∣teth aduoutry: and he that dothe mary her that is so letten go, is an aduoutrer. Nowe to what ende and vse this reuerende and moste worthy sacrament was cōmaun∣ded, we wyll declare. It was or∣deyned for an helpe, for propaga∣tion, and to auoyde fornication.

¶ The fyrst cause is taken, where god dydde institute this holy my∣sterye vnder these wordes: It is * not good a man to be alone, let vs make for hym an helper lyke hym selfe. For man sythens he is a cre∣ature mooste accompenable, then trewely and well shal vse the office and duety of a man, and shall pre∣pare a trusty keper of his lyfe and
Page  [unnumbered]
goodes, when he entreth into the stedfaste and indissoluble felowe∣shyp of matrimony. And therfore bothe to men that be somewhat a∣ged yea and to those that be decre¦pite, and in whō there is no might of generation, no hope left of pro∣pagation, it is neuerlesse laufull to mary, and (if a man may say it) often tymes nessary, wherby they maye passe forthe the later dayes of theyr lyfe, in the companye of theyr well be loued wyfe, with more ioye, suertye, and lesse care. Wherof Dauid, verye olde, with * the Sunamite maide, is an exam¦ple. For what felowshyp mought happen amonge men, more holye and pleasaunte? what more surer? what lesse careful, what more chast then the lyfe of manne and wyfe? when eyther of theym is the same
Page  [unnumbered]
that the other is, in one agreable mynde two bodyes, in two bodies one mynde and one consent. Only man and wyfe, one enuieth not an other, they alone loue eche other, out of measure, in as moche as eyther of them hole hangeth of the other, and hath quietnes and reste in the other, one fleshe, one minde, one concorde, one heuynesse gre∣ueth them bothe, one myrth equal∣ly reioyseth bothe, the verye same and euen lyke wyl is in both, theyr wynnynge is common to both, the same ryches, the same pouerte, like dignitie and worthynes, they be alwayes of one chaumbre, and at one table, they kepe company to∣gether, nyght and day, in sleping, nor in wakynge they departe not the one frome the other: but theyr lyfe is conioyned in all actes, la∣bours,
Page  [unnumbered]
ieoperdyes, and in euerye chaunce the one serueth the other, as longe as they lyue, they kepe company together to theyr lyues ende, they neuer departe without they dye, and the one beinge dead. the other canne scante lyue. Soo great is wedlockes loue, that v∣neth deathe can set a sonder those, whom lyfe hath knytte together. Suche is the perseuerance of ma∣trimony, suche is the vnitie, that one husband shuld haue one wife, and one wyfe one husebande. For one rybbe at the begynnynge was turned in to one wyfe. And there * shal be saith god, two in one fleshe. He sayth not, three or mo. And in * the arch of Noe god commaunded no mo women to be preserued then men, that for one man there shuld be but one wyfe. For where a man
Page  [unnumbered]
hath many wyues, or a womanne many husbandes: there the vnitie of matrimony faylethe. Therfore her alone that a man hath taken to his wyfe, the same let hym kepe without violation of kyndenesse, to the last ende of his lyfe in a per∣fecte loue and continuall remem∣brance. Let the father gyue place, the mother gyue place, the chyl∣dren, the brothers and systers, let al the heape of frendes gyue place to the swete beneuolēce and entier loue of man and wife, and that for great skyl. For the father, mother, chyldren, brethern, systers, kyns∣folke, be the frendes of nature, and workes of fortune: man and wyfe be the mistery of god. And the man had a wyfe, & the wyfe a husband, before father, mother, brother, or chyldren. And therfore it was com¦maunded *
Page  [unnumbered]
to the man, to leaue fa∣ther and mother, systers, brethern, and chyldren, and cleaue to his wyfe, that aboue all other thyn∣ges he shuld kepe to his liues end that thynge, whiche was fyrste of all gyuen vnto hym: nor that one of them shuld at any tyme be with out the other, of whome the one was not made without the other. Wherfore the chyldren to departe from theyr parentes, and the pa∣rentes to leaue theyr chyldren, no lawe forbyddeth, sometyme neces∣sitie compelleth, profyte styrreth, consideratiō moueth, the children often tymes be dymissed from au∣ctoritie of theyr parentes, they ofte chalenge to them selfe lybertie by religion, often tymes in straunge countreys they get they lyuynge, & in other places seke theyr dwel∣lynge:
Page  [unnumbered]
but the wyfe from her hus∣bande, or the husbande from his wyfe, no lawe, no necessitie, no pro fyte, no consideration, no deuorse, no religion, no licence, no absence, dothe permytte to departe. For whiche of theym, that leaueth or neglecteth to kepe company toge∣ther, the same as forsaken, and so∣litary alone, must of necessitie lede a lyfe moste wretched, destitute of all gladnesse and helpe, bycause the helpe that was made for hym of god, and the companion of ioye and gladnes to hym gyuen, he ne∣glectynge depyseth to take, or con¦temptuousiy is bolde to leaue and forsake.

¶ The seconde cause of matrymo ny, we shewed to be for propaga∣tion of chyldren, as it is red, where god blessed Adam and Eue, say∣inge:
Page  [unnumbered]
Encrease, and multiply, and * replenyshe the earthe. Which bles∣synge after the floudde, was euen freshe agayn renewed by the same wordes. The effect wherof is, that * man shulde render to nature, that he had borowed of her, and to the image of god, shulde brynge forth and nourysshe chyldren lyke hym selfe, and restore the comon felow∣shyp of mankinde with a certayne successiō, and to kepe it perpetual. which blessinge he that dyd not re∣garde, in the old lawe, was coun∣ted of all men cursed and most vn∣happy, as it is wrytten: Cursed is she, that hath not sede in Israell, and blessed is he, whose sede is in Syon. Whervpon Abraham for * the meryte of his fayth, was bles∣sed in his generation, and Sara beinge then olde, and past chylde
Page  [unnumbered]
bearynge, dyd put awaye the ma∣ledictiō of her barennes, with this blessing of generation. For in this sacrament it is not the meryte of nature, to conceyue chyldren, but the blessynge of almyghtye God, and a mistery far passynge the me∣rytes of nature. Whiche thynge was not vnknowen to Jacob the Patriarch, the whiche when his wyfe Rachel thought that the ac∣companienge with her husbande, was to gyue chyldren, said to him, Gyue me chyldren, or elles I am but deade, Jacob answered: Am * I then in goddes stede, which ke∣peth the fruite of thy wombe from the? And Isaac made intercession * to god, for his wyfe, bycause she was bareyn, whiche harde his pe∣tition, and made her to conceyue. For they knewe, that the frutes of
