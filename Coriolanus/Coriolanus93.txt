First Senator
You are a Roman, are you?
MENENIUS

spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now
presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.
To CORIOLANUS

The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than
thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!
thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's
