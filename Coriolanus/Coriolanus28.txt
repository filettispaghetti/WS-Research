and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
second day of audience. When you are hearing a
matter between party and party, if you chance to be
pinched with the colic, you make faces like
mummers; set up the bloody flag against all
patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,
dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled

How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,
were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow
your eyes so fast?
VOLUMNIA
Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for
the love of Juno, let's go.
MENENIUS
Ha! Marcius coming home!
VOLUMNIA
Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous
approbation.
MENENIUS
Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!
Marcius coming home!
VOLUMNIA VIRGILIA
Nay,'tis true.
VOLUMNIA
Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
