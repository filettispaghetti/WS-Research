Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come gentlemen,
Let us consult upon to-morrow's business
In to our tent; the air is raw and cold.
They withdraw into the tent

Enter, to his tent, KING RICHARD III, NORFOLK, RATCLIFF, CATESBY, and others

KING RICHARD III
What is't o'clock?
CATESBY
It's supper-time, my lord;
It's nine o'clock.
KING RICHARD III
I will not sup to-night.
Give me some ink and paper.
What, is my beaver easier than it was?
And all my armour laid into my tent?
CATESBY
If is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.
KING RICHARD III
Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.
NORFOLK
I go, my lord.
KING RICHARD III
Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk.
NORFOLK
I warrant you, my lord.
Exit

KING RICHARD III
Catesby!
CATESBY
My lord?
KING RICHARD III
Send out a pursuivant at arms
To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power
Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
Into the blind cave of eternal night.
Exit CATESBY

Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.
Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
Ratcliff!
RATCLIFF
My lord?
KING RICHARD III
Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?
RATCLIFF
