of those sacramentes which haue the ma∣nifest word of god and be institute bi christ to signifye vnto us the remissyon of our sinnes. s. Austen saith that there be but .ij. such sacramentes in the .cxviij. pistle vnto Ianuarius: His wordes be these. First I wold haue the to vnderstōd the somme and effect of this disputacyō / which is this that our lord Iesus Christ (as he him self saith in the gospel) hath ladē us but with a light and easy yock or burden. Wherfore he hath glewed the felowship of his newe peple with sacramentes / very fewe in nomber / very easy to be kept / and very excellent in signifycacyon / which be baptyme and the supper of the lord and such other if there be any moo commanded in the holy scripture those except which were burdēs for the ser∣uytute of the peple in the old lawe for the hardnes of their hartes et ce. And agayne in the .iij. boke of the lerning of a Christen man he saith the scripture hath taught us but fewe signes / as be the sacramēt of bap∣tyme

and the solemne celebracyon and re∣memberance of the body and blode of the lord et ce.

The bisshop of london could scarsly suf∣fer me to speake thus moch / but he brake forth and said thus vnto me / where as ye affirme all right and true sacramentes to be institute of Christ or to haue the mani∣fest scripture to proue them or that all sa∣cramentes must haue a significacyō of re∣missyon of sinnes / It is all false. Than I answered that I wold proue all that I had sayd to be true not only by the scriptu∣re but by the old doctors and by the schole writers also.

But the bisshop of herforth (whom the kings grace fauored highly both for his sin¦gular wisdom and lerning / which was thā newe comne out of germany where he had bene Imbassytor) being moued with the frowardnes of this bisshop of londō sayd vnto me brother Alexander contend not moch with him about the myndes and
Page  [unnumbered]
sayngs of the doctors and schole writers / for ye knowe that thei in many places doo differ among them selfes and that thei are contrary to them selues also almost in eue∣ry article. And there is no hope of any con∣cord to be made if we must leane to their iudgementes in these maters of controuer∣sy / and we be commāded by the kings gra¦ce to dispute by the holy scripture / et c. And he turned him to the bisshops and made a short and pythy oracyon. Think ye not / sayd he / that we can by any sophistical sut∣tiltes steale out of the world agayn / the light which euery man doth see / Christ hath so lightned the world at this tyme that the light of the gospel hath put to fli∣ght all misty darknes and it wil shortly ha¦ue the higher hād of all cloudes though we resist in vaine neuer so moch. The lay pe∣ple do now knowe the holy scripture better than many of us. And the germanes haue made the text of the Bible so playne and easy by the hebrewe and the greke tōg that
Page  [unnumbered]
now many things may be better vnder∣stand without any gloses at all than by all the commentarys of the doctors. And more ouer thei haue so openned these controuer∣sys by their writings that womē and chil∣dern may wonder at the blindnes & fals∣hode that hath bene hetherto. Wherfor ye must consider ernestly what ye wil deter∣myne of these controuersys / that ye make not your selues to be mocked and laughed to storne of all the world / and that ye bring them not to haue this opinion of yow to think euer more here after that ye haue neyther one sparke of lerning nor yet of godlines in yow. And thus shal ye lose all your estimacyon and auctoryte with them which before toke yow for lerned men and profitable membres vnto the comon welth of Christendome. For that which yow do hope vpon / that there was neuer heresy in the church so gret but that processe of tyme with the pour and auctorite of the pope hath quenched it / it is nothing to the pur∣pose.
Page  [unnumbered]
But ye must turne your opinyon and think this surely that there is nothing so feble and weake / so that it be true / but it shal find place and be able to stand against all falshode. Truth is the doughter of ty∣me / and tyme is the mother of truth. And what so euer is beseged of truth can not long continue / and vpon whose syde truth doth stand / that ought not to be thought transitory or that it wil euer falle. All things consist not in painted eloquence & strenght or auctorite. For the truth is of so gret pour / strength and efficacite / that it cā neyther be defended with wordes nor be ouercomne with any strength / but after she hath hidden hir self long / at length she putteth vp hir head and appereth / and as it is written in Esdra / a king is strong / wy∣ne is strongar / yet wemen be more strong But truth excellyth all.

He spake many more things to this pur∣pose & effect very discretely to the high de∣lyte of all that hard him. And I thinking
Page  [unnumbered]
my selfe to be encoraged by his oracyon / I began thus to reason against the bisshop of london.

Sacramentes be signes or ceremonys which make us certē and sure of the wil of god. But no mans hart can be certen and sure of the wil of god with out the word of god / wherfor it foloweth that there be no sacramentes without the word of god / and such as can not be proued out of the holy scripture ought not to be called sacramen∣tes. The first part of this reason is Sanct Pauls own saing the .iiij. to the Romanes where he saith that circumcisyon is a tokē and a seale of the rightwisnes of faith. Ergo it requyreth faith to certify mans hart of the wil of god. But the word of god is the foundacyon of faith / the .x. to the Ro¦ma. Faith cometh bi hearing / and hearing cometh by the word of god. For the mynd must be taught and instruct of the wil of god by the word / like as the ey is taught & instruct by the outward ceremony. And
Page  [unnumbered]
Paul by this saing confuteth this opinyō that the sacramētes shuld make mē righ∣tuos and iust before god for the very out∣ward work without faith of them that re∣ceyue thē and after this maner doth Paul speak vnto the Ephesyans that christ doth sanctifie his church thorow the bath of wa∣ter in the word of life. And for as moch as he ioyneth the word vnto the ceremony & declareth the vertu and pour of the word of god that it bringeth with him life / he doth manifestly teach that the word of god is the principal thing & euyn as it were the very substance and body of the sacrament and the outward ceremony nothing els thā a token of that lyuely inflāmacyon which we receyue thorow faith in the word and promes. S. Paul also in ministring the sa¦cramēt of the lordes supper doth manifest∣ly adde the wordes of Christ: He toke bre∣ad / saith he / and whan he had geuen than∣kes he brake it and sayd / take ye this and eate ye this for it is my body. Item do ye
Page  [unnumbered]
this in my rememberans. Beside this he teacheth euidently that only christ and no∣ne but he had pour to institute a sacramēt and that neither the apostels nor the church hath any auctorite to alter or to adde any thing vnto his ordināce / where as he saith / For I receiued of the lord that which I d•lyuered vnto yow et ce. To what purpose shuld he go a bout to moue the peple to bile∣ue him and to wīne their hartes with this protestacyon if it had bene lauful for him to haue made any sacramentes or to haue altered the forme & maner of ministring this sacrament / as some men both wicked∣ly and shamelesly do affirme that the apo∣stles did alter the forme of baptyme. Whā I had spoken thus moch / the bisshop of lō∣don did interrupt me / and sayd / let us grāt that the sacramentes may be gathered out of the word of god / yet are you farre decey∣ued if ye think that there is no nother word of god but that which euery sowter and co∣bler do reade in their mother tong. And if
Page  [unnumbered]
ye think that nothing perteyneth vnto the Christen faith but that only that is writ∣ton in the byble / than erre ye playnly with the Lutheranes. For. S. Iohan saith that Iesus did many things which be not writ¦ton. And. S. Paul commandeth the Thes¦salonians to obserue and kepe certē vnwrit¦ton tradicyons and ceremonys .ij. Thessa. ij. Moreouer he him self did preach not the scripture only but euen also the tradicyons of the elders Act. xvj. Finally we haue re∣ceyued many things of the doctors and councels by tymes which although thei be not writton in the bible / yet for as moch as the old doctors of the church do make men∣cyon of thē / we ought to grant that we re∣ceiued them of the apostles / and that thei be of like autoryte with the scripture / and fi∣nally that thei may worthily be called the word of god vnwritton.

Now whan the right noble lord Crum∣wel / the Archbisshop with the other biss∣hops which did defend the pure doctrine of
Page  [unnumbered]
the gospel hard this / thei smyled alytle one vpō a nother for as moch as thei sawe him flee euen in the very beginning of the di∣sputacyon vnto his old rusty sophistry and vnwritton verites. And I wold haue di∣sputed further with the bisshop to haue cō∣futed this blasphemos lye / But the lord Crumwel bad me be content for the tyme began to go away and it was .xij. of the clock / and thus I made an end with this protestacyon. Right reuerend master biss∣hop ye denye that our Christē faith and re¦ligyō doth leane only vpon the word of god which is writton in the bible / which thing if I can proue and declare / than ye wil grant me that there be no sacramētes but those that haue the manifest word of god to confirme them / vnto this he did consent and than immediately that assemble was dissolued for that day.

Now the next day whan the bisshops were assembled agayne and I was present with the lord crumwel / there came vnto me
Page  [unnumbered]
a certē archdeacon in the name of the arch¦bisshop of cātorbery which told me that the other bishops were greuosly offended w•th me / that I being a stranger shuld be ad∣mitted vnto their disputacyō / which thing whan I had shewed vnto the lord crum∣wel he thought it best to gyue place vnto the bisshops specially be cause he wold not procure me their hatred / for he knewe wel that if thei had ones conceiued in their har∣tes any malyce against any mā thei wold neuer cease til thei had gotē him out of the way / and thei had before brought to death diuerse whom the king did highly fauor / before the king him self (whom thei mo∣ued by all meanes to put them to execucy∣on quickly) could perceyue & spye out their craft and suttilty. But he bad me gyue hym the paper wherin I had writton my disputacyon that he might shewe it to the bisshop of londō & to the other bisshops in the councel / the cōtentes wherof was this.

Right honorable and noble lord / and ye
Page  [unnumbered]
right reuerend fathers / yesterday whan I disputed of the sacramentes with the bis∣shop of london / we came thus farre that those only ought to be called sacramentes which haue the word of god for them / and this point only remained to be further de∣clared that nothing ought to be taken for the word of god but only the holy bokes of the old and newe testamēt. For the bisshop of london affirmed that the tradicions and ceremonys wherof the old ecclesiastical wri¦ters do make mencyon / were receiued of the apostles and geuen us of the fathers from hand to hand and therfor thei may be lau∣fully called the word of god vnwrittō / and our faith must be proued by them as well as by the holy scripture which is writton in the bible.

Now I haue determined to cōfute this saing and opinyō and to shewe by the ma∣nifest testimonys of christ / of the Apostles of the prophetes and also of the old doctors that the Christen faith ought to leane on∣ly
Page  [unnumbered]
vpon the holy scripture and that the bo∣kes of the old & newe testament only ought to be had and taken for the word of god. And because there hangeth a nother dispu¦tacyō vpon this / that is to say / of the auc¦torite of the doctors and of councels / I wil also speake of them. For cochleus and other blasphemos lyers which for the bellys sake haue salable tūges and in whom the saing which Paul alledgeth against them that mainteyne wicked doctrine for their bellys sake doth very wel agre / saing. The cretyās are alweys false lyers / wicked beastes and slowe bellys. These hipocrites I say / do plainly hold that the church (that is to say the bisshops / as thei vnderstond) hath pour to iudge ouer the scripture and to examyne it / and also that it hath auctoryte to allo∣we or to refuse the gospel / and to dispense with the .x. commandments and to alter the forme of baptyme and to make newe articles of our faith beside those which be conteined in the scripture. Some there be
Page  [unnumbered]
that speake yet more reuerently saing that thei contend not of the scripture or of the word of god but of the exposicyon theroff which thei wil haue to be taken and sought of the church and of the doctors which be a∣lowed of the church / vnto whose iudgemēt thei say we ought to stand in all cōtrouer∣sys of our faith what so euer thei deere whether thei haue any scripture for them or no.

This sophistical suttelty although it hath more coning than the first grosse blas∣phemy / yet it is to the same effect and thei both haue one end and defend both one opi∣nion. But yet / before the bisshop of londō / there was neuer none so farre past shame as to say that the rytes and ceremonys in the church which can not be proued by the scripture ought to be called the word of god vnwritten▪ and that we ought to byld our faith vp on them as vp on the holy scriptu¦re written in the bible.

This threfold maze / or rather one tra••¦formed
Page  [unnumbered]
.iij. ways / couered & painted with diuers wordes hath those reasons onli to cō∣firme it which the bisshop did before alled∣ge for the vnwritton word / and certē other which I wil reherse and confute in the end of this writing.
