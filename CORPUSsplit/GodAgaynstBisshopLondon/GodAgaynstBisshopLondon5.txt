from the lauful creatures and ordinances of god / which shuld driue christ out of the comp•ny of men and out of the ordinary & comon life / in to the w•ldernes againe / and shu•d shutte him vp in deanes & klo∣sters / or presons rather / among the capti∣ue presoners / he saith also that thei shal byld & cōfirme their preaching / doctryne / & lawes / not by the word of god / or by the holy wordes of the old Prophecyes / that is to say by the scripture / but by false sig∣nes & lying miracles / & that thei shal so myghtily blinde and deceyue the vnfaith∣ful & such as haue not receyued the truth of gods word but haue suffred thē selues to be ledde a way from it & to be seduced tho∣row miracles / that euē the elect / if it were possible / might be deceyued. And he mo∣nissheth us of these thīgs so ernestly / that he calleth vpon heauē & erth to beare him witnes / that he did premonissh and declare these things vnto us before / of the Anti∣christes that shuld come / wherby he decla¦reth
Page  [unnumbered]
what sorow and care he taketh for us & how sore he lamenteth that we shuld perissh & be damned thorow such blasphe∣my of Antichrist. And euen after this sa∣me maner & with like wordes doth the pro¦phete Esay thonder for the defence of gods word against the doctrynes & tradicyons of men / saing. All flessh is euen grasse / & all the glory of it / that is to say euen his most excellent wisdom & pour / is euen ly∣ke the floure of an herbe. the grasse widde∣reth away and the floure of the herbe fal∣leth a way for the spyryte & breath of the lord hath blowne vpon it. And the peple be very grasse. the grasse / I say / widdereth & the floure falleth / but the word of the lord endureth for euer &c. He threatneth also euerlasting night of infidelyte or vnbyle∣fe / if we beleue eyther any newe reuelacy¦ons withowt the word of god / or els any ap¦paricyōs of dead spretes. The wordes after the true hebrue text be these. Shal the pe∣ple
Page  [unnumbered]
seke councel of their god / or shal thei a∣re councel of the deade for the liuyng? shal thei not rather loke & serch in the lawe of the lord / and tak the testimony of god vnto councel? Iff thei tel you not (saith he) ac∣cording vnto this word / thei shal haue no mornīg lyght. Sureli this is a sore threat∣ning vnto them which vnderstond what this voyce is / what this derknes signify∣eth and who is the auctor & causer of it. Iohn calleth christ the light that shyneth in darknes & that lightneth all mē which come in to this world / he saith that the true life is in the word of god / & that life is the light of men / & again that god is the light in whom is no darknes at all / & that who so euer walketh in darknes / hath no felow∣ship with god. And christ calleth hī self the life of the world / & he saith vnto us. Walk in the light whyle ye haue it / that no dark∣nes compasse now &c. Now the deuel is the prince of all darknes / he did first steale this light from mankind thorow infidelite / he
Page  [unnumbered]
did first robbe us of the true knowlege of god and brought us in to all darknes of in∣fydelite / and in to all kindes of errors. But the sonne of rigtuosnes hath restored this light vnto the world agayne / and his co∣ming was vnto us the bright mornīg whe¦rof Esay speaketh in this place. And it is no meruel that we haue walked in a conti¦nual darknes thus long / for we haue forsa∣ken the word of god and sought the light in the deuils doctrine / in our own wisdom / in mans tradicyons / & we haue had so gret confydence in fantasyes / that we haue by∣leued deade spyrites & made newe artycles of our fayth euen owt of the appearing of them / as namely that there is a purgatory after this life out of the which soules may be redemed thorow the sacrifice of the mas¦se / which the pope and the deuyl haue ordey¦ned to be a sacrifice for the quick and the deade contrary to the institutyon and ordi∣nāce of christ. But now let us heare what witnesse christ him selfe the euerlasting
Page  [unnumbered]
word of god geueth of his scripture. For the same question was disputed of / euē in christes tyme among the high doctors whi¦ch thought that the scripture without the tradicyons of the elders / was not sufficient vnto their saluacyon and one of those doc∣tors came to christ and saide / master what may I doo to enioye euerlasting life? But christ sēt this curios infidele vnto the scrip¦ture / sayng / what is writton in the lawe? How dost thow reade thereī? as though he shuld say. Doist thou thinck that god is a wauerer or a changeling that wil alter his mynd euery howr as men change their la∣wes / and imagine dayli newe opinions of god? I tell the the word of god continueth for euer / and do thou nothing but euen the selfe thing only that thow seyst writton in the law / and so thou shalt liue: he saith not now how thinkest thou / or how dost thow heare the pharises & the scribes preach & teach / but he sendeth hym to the scriptu∣re and sayth what readest thou there? Do
Page  [unnumbered]
that & thou shalt lyue. And although the scribes / pharises and doctors did euer patch their lawes and tradicyons vnto t•e word of god / yea and preferred thē also before it / as christ sheweth in the .xv. & .xxiij. of Mathew / yet all other among w•om the true church did raygne had on iudgement & bylefe / namely that the wil of god must be known by the scripture only & that a•l articles must be iudged and examyned by it / as christ declareth where as he saith vn∣to the iewes. Serch the scriptures for ye be¦leue surely that ye shal haue euerlasting li∣fe in thē by the which wordes christ testifi∣eth playnly that this was the opynion and iudgement of the o•d church / that all men shuld knowe the wil of god by the scriptu∣re only / and that thei shuld iudge all arti∣cles of the faith necessari vnto saluacyon / by that only. And where as he biddeth thē exam•ne his preaching by the scripture / he sheweth euidently euin the whole gospel to becōteyned in the old scripture. And who
Page  [unnumbered]
so euer denieth the cōmandment of Moy∣ses before rehersed to perteyne vnto us be∣cause the Apostles had not yet writtō the∣ir bokes / thei be very asseheades withowt any knoulege or vnderstōding. For this ru∣le did the Apostels folowe whan thei testifi¦ed vn to the church of the gospel / that no boke shuld be receyued / except it consentyd with the old scripture / and by this rule the church refused the bokes which confirmed their storys by the prophetes. And by this rule do the Euangelistes proue their wri∣tings / & Paul also procureth auctorite vn to his pistle to the Roma .j. by this same ru¦le / where as he saith that his gospel was be¦fore promised by the prophetes in the holy scriptures. To this purpose also serue these saings of christ. If ye beleued Moyses / ye wold bileue me also / for he wrote of me &c. and agayne this / Serche the scriptures &c. for euen thei beare witnesse of me. Now this controuersy of the vnwritton word & of mans gloses and tradicyons / if we wil
Page  [unnumbered]
folow the councel of our fore fathers and stande to the iudgement of the church in christes tyme / I wil lay this sentēce of the old church confirmed of christ for me / aga∣inst all that my aduersarys can make or say / writton in the xij. of Iohn / The word which I haue spoken shal iudge them in the last day. And if this word were not writtō / or if it were not all writton / who could besure & certen of his saluacyon / or of the wil and pleasure of god. And if our faith and the saluacyon of mankynd did de¦pend only of mennes doctryne / so that the sōme & rule of our religion were not writ¦ton in the scripture / who durst trust & bile¦ue that one hole / perfight and vnblemis∣shed sentence of christ were left vnto us? For seing the deuel wresteth the scripture vnto eueri wicked opinyon and durst refu∣se the scripture thorow the Manicheis / as he doth now adays cause it be burnt by the bisshops / who dowteth but that he wold ra¦ther haue destroyed the whole scripture at
Page  [unnumbered]
ones more than .xv. hundreth yere agone / and to haue set vp in the steade of it / his own blasphemes / and that thei shuld ha∣ue bene called the writton word of god ra∣ther thā the vnwritton & inuented word. Oh lord / the holy gost had euel prouided for us if he had left us in the holy scriptu∣re only part of the word and will of god. And how could god haue lauffully dāned us for receyuing strange doctrines euen af¦ter the commandmentes of the bisshops if he had not left all things necessary for our saluacyon / writton in his holy word? And againe where as christ cōmandeth us to heare the church / if we shuld not know the true church only by the scripture / but by pour auc torite & saccession: who shuld haue durst ones to haue opened his lippes against the Idolatrissh seruice and false tradiciōs of the bishops or ones haue whis¦spred against any wickednes / had it bene neuer so manifest?

But thei being thorouly blīded do not per∣ceyue
Page  [unnumbered]
this most shameful and detestable blasphemy: Thei doo not consyder / what ignorance / neclygence & vnmerci∣fulnes thei ascrybe vnto god / whā as thei say that god did not regard that the word shuld be writton whereby he saith that we shal be iudged at the latter day. But the holy gost esspyed before the malyce of the deuel and also this blasphemy / and therfor to represse and confownd his purpose and tyranny / and agayne to stopp the mouthes of all other / he enioyned his scribes (that is to say the Prophetes / Apostels and euan∣gelistes) to wryte this word: that we shuld haue by us a sure and a perpetual testimo∣ny whereunto we might surely trust and wherby he might shew & declare hym sel∣fe to damne the wicked lawfully. And he cōmanded the apostels that thei shuld bea∣re witnes of this scripture / and that thei shulde reiecte all other writinges whose so euer thei were / which went abowt to mixe their lyes with the gospel / lyke as. s.
Page  [unnumbered]
luke in the prologe of his gospel / sayth / I thought it good to wryte vnto the / gentil brother Theophyl / all things which I ha∣ue serched out with all dilygence from the beginning / that thou mightest haue a per∣fight groūde to bild thy fayth vp on which thou le•nydst in thy youth &c. By this so euydent a testymony hath the holy goost stablysshed & confirmed our hartes agay∣nst the blasphemy of antichrist which accu¦seth the holy gost of most shameful wicked¦nes and vnrightuosnes / saing that he did not regard to wryte all Articles of our chri¦sten religyon and faith / but that he wold thei shuld depend vpon vncerten doctrynes which the bisshops might make and alter as oft as thei list. And the holy gost was not content with this one testimony / but he caused the self same euangelist which had promised him self to wryte all things from the beginnig with all diligēce / to te∣stifye agayne that he had fulfilled his pro∣mes / for in the begīnig of the actes he saith
Page  [unnumbered]
that he hath writtō in the story of his gos∣pel of all things which christ both did and taught euē vntyl that day that he left this world. And because there were certē which did falsely wrytte and wrest this place / the holy father Chrisostome doth expownd it thus / There be some that enquire / how lu∣ke could wryght of all things which christ both did & taught seīg Iohn sayth it were impossible to wryte all thīgs / whom I ans¦wer / saith he / luke meneth not al thīgs but of all things necessary vnto our saluaci∣on. But the holy gost nedeth no helpe of a∣niman to cōfirm his wordes / for he which is the most coning craftesman of all and hath the knoulege of all wordes did espie be¦fore what cauillacyon the deuel wold make at that / & therfor he maketh answere vn∣to it euen by the self same euangelist. For where as Ihon had sayd that Iesus had done many miracles which be not writtō / he addeth immediatly and saith / These be writtō that ye shuld bileue that Iesus
Page  [unnumbered]
is the son of god & that ye beleuing / shuld haue euerlastīg life hy his name. By th•s wordes it is manifest that the sōme of all christes doctrine and so many miracles al∣so were writton / as be sufficyent to confir¦me our faith & all maner of articles whi∣che we be bownd to byleue. For this article that Iesus is the son of god & the promi∣sed seede which shuld breake the serpentes heade and restore that lyfe which the deuel had stolen from us and had brought agay∣ne & restored thorow the apperyng of the gospel / that light which was darckened & hidden by the prince of darknes / vnto the∣myserable world sitting or liuing before in darknes & in the shadowe of death / this article I say is the sōme of the whole scrip¦ture and the principal point or article of s. Iohns gospel. And for this articles sake he sayth in his first pistel that he wrote all things vnto all men / and that he which by¦leueth in the son / hathe the witnesse ī him selfe / that is to say / he doth vnderstonde
Page  [unnumbered]
the somme of the whole scripture. And be¦cause god wold haue the holy bokes wr•ttō testifye of this sede that was to come / na∣mely / the son of god / the whole scripture is a testimony of this christ and son of god / & there are many t•m•s dyuerse witnesses alledged in the scripture to beare witnes of christ that he is the son of god cōceyued by the holy gost / borne of the virgine suffred death / & is rysen vp agayn &c. And vnto this had he respect wh•n he sayd. Serche the scriptures for thei beare witnes of me. And peter speaketh in like maner s•īg. All the prophet•s do witnesse with h•m that god forgeueth all the syn̄es vnto them whi¦ch bileue and put their confydence in this christ. And Paul saith in lyke maner that rightuosnes was testifyed of / in the lawe & in the prophetes. Wherfore thos testimo¦nys which proue Iesus to be the son of god do sufficiently proue also our whole christē faith / and all maner of articles necessar•y to saluacyon and to euerlasting life.

Page  [unnumbered]
And it were no hard thing to dyduce and drawe all the articles of the faith euen owt of this one. For he that byleueth Ie∣sus to be the son of god / must nedes also gr∣ant god the father almyghty / maker of he∣auen and erth / to be the natural father of our lord Iesus christ and that for his sake he is our father and we be the sōnes of god for Iesus sake and thorow him. And christ saith byleue ye in god? so byleue in me also: do ye not byleue that I am in the father and the father in me? And Iohn saith / who so euer confesseth Iesus to be the son of god / khe hath both the father & the son. Item who so euer bileueth Iesus to be the natural son of god / must nedes acknoulege that he is that Emanuel of whom Esay did Prophecy that he shuld be borne of a virgyn and shuld suffer death lyke as other scriptures had before testifyed & he saythe O ye folisshe hartes harde to by∣leue all thīgs which the prophetes haue told yow. Must not Christ nedes haue suffred
Page  [unnumbered]
all these things & so entre in to his glory? Agayne it was impossyble that the son of god shuld be holdē down of death / but that he shuld breake the paynes of hell & ryse vp agayne. As peter doth proue in the ac∣tes out of Dauyd / and lyke wise Paul to proue his ascensyon vnto heauen alledgeth this verse out of the psalm / Thou didst asc∣end vnto the highth / And tokest captyuyte prysoner / and gauest dyuers gyftes vnto men. And dauyd speaketh of this son saing The lord sayd vnto my lord / syt at my ri∣ght hand vntyl I make thy emnys thy fo∣testole: Which place paul expowndeth of the kingdom of christ after his resurrectiō and ascensyon .j. to the coryn .xv. Further∣more if thou byleuest Iesus to be the son of god / than thou shalt grant that he hath sent the holy gost to sanctifye the congre∣gacyon that is to say all the faythful accor¦ding to his promes / and that he is the god in whose name he cōmanded that we shuld be baptysed / lyke as in his fathers name
Page  [unnumbered]
and his. Itē all the prophetes do beare wit∣nes of the holy gost / namely that we must receyue remissyon of synnes thorow his na¦me and he promyseth that he wil rayse us vp againe vnto euerlastīg life. These thin∣ges haue I spoken the more largely for the shameful cauellacyon and blasphemy of London which denyeth that all the articles of our faith can be proued by the scripture / because. s. Iohn saith that Iesus dyd ma∣ny miracles which be not writton in this boke.

Now wil I alledge the myndes of Ciril∣lus and. s. Austen to confute this wicked and blasphemos opinyon.

Cyrillus writing vpon Iohn. the .xij. chap. speaketh thus: Iohn saith there is a gret multitude and an infinyte nomber of the myracles which the lord did / but those / saith he / which we haue shewed yow be suf¦ficyent to them that reade them diligently for the stablysshing & confirmacyon of a perfight fayth / and I am not to be blamed
Page  [unnumbered]
though I haue not writton them all. For if all were gathered one by one / none left out / the whole world wold not receyue the multytude of the bokes. Wherfor all that he did were not writtō: But all things whi¦ch the writers thought sufficyent both for the fayth and bylefe / and also for the life and conuersacyon of men / that we myght shyne with a right and perfight fayth and with true workes & vertues / and so come vnto the kyngdom of heauen thorow our lord christ be wrytton / wherfor it is a newe¦lye / lately inuēted in the deuels shop to say that all the articles of the christen fayth can not be proued by the scripture / and that mēs tradicyōs besyde the scripture be good workes and please god. Now ye may see that the church in Cyrillus tyme did not acknoulege this wicked blasphemy.

Austen affirmeth the same writing vp on this place of Iohn / these be writton that ye shuld byliue etc. Our lord Iesus saith he / did many miracles but all be not writ∣ton
Page  [unnumbered]
/ for those that shuld be writtō were spe¦cialy chosen & pyked owt as many as wer thought necessary and sufficient for the sal¦uacyō of the faithful. By these auctorites ye may see that thei belye the old doctors which say that they maynteyne any such blasphemy. But now to make an end of alledging any more testimonies. I wil cy∣te only .ij. specyal and most faithful wit∣nesses against this deuelyssh sophistical ca¦uillacyon and opinyon / namely Peter and Paul and so wil I make an end. For euery man that hath any witt at all may plaīly perceyue that Peter wrote his second pistle against such blasphemers as do imagine a new word of god besyde that which is writ¦ton. For he calleth the scripture euen a ve∣ry true prophecy and he calleth them false / or lyeng Prophetes which teach cōtrary to this prophetical and Apostolical prophecy or any thing which is not conteyned in it. and he teacheth this rule wherby we shuld auoyde all maner of lyes that we shuld
Page  [unnumbered]
trye and examine them by this prophetical word or prophetical scripture wherunto he cōmandeth us to haue a specyal eye as vn∣to the candel which dryueth out and banish¦eth away all darknes and lyes of the deuel. His wordes be these.

I wryte vnto yow this second pistle to prick you vp & to quyckē your hartes that ye might remember the wordes which ha∣ue bene told now before by the holy prophe¦tes / and also the wordes of our message and cōmandment which be the Apostles of the lord and sauior / for ye must knowe that in the latter dayes there shal come mockers
