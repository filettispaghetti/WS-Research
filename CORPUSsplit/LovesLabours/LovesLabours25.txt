Singing

DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years; take this key,
give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately
hither: I must employ him in a letter to my love.
MOTH
Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
How meanest thou? brawling in French?
MOTH
No, my complete master: but to jig off a tune at
the tongue's end, canary to it with your feet, humour
it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and
sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you
swallowed love with singing love, sometime through
the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling
love; with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of
your eyes; with your arms crossed on your thin-belly
doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in
your pocket like a man after the old painting; and
keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.
These are complements, these are humours; these
betray nice wenches, that would be betrayed without
these; and make them men of note--do you note
me?--that most are affected to these.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
How hast thou purchased this experience?
MOTH
By my penny of observation.
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
But O,--but O,--
MOTH
'The hobby-horse is forgot.'
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Callest thou my love 'hobby-horse'?
MOTH
No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your
love perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?
DON
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Almost I had.
MOTH
Negligent student! learn her by heart.
