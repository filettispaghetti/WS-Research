For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;
And rail upon the hostess of the house;
And say you would present her at the leet,
Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:
Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.

Ay, the woman's maid of the house.
Third Servant

Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,
As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece
And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell
And twenty more such names and men as these
Which never were nor no man ever saw.

ALL
Amen.
SLY
I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.

My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;
I am your wife in all obedience.
SLY

Lord
Madam.
SLY
Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?
Lord
'Madam,' and nothing else: so lords
call ladies.
SLY
Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd
And slept above some fifteen year or more.

Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
