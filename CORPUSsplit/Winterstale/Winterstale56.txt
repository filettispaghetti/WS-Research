scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in
request, I can tell you.
MOPSA
We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou
shalt hear; 'tis in three parts.
DORCAS
We had the tune on't a month ago.
AUTOLYCUS
I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my
occupation; have at it with you.
SONG

AUTOLYCUS
Get you hence, for I must go
Where it fits not you to know.
DORCAS
Whither?
MOPSA
O, whither?
DORCAS
Whither?
MOPSA
It becomes thy oath full well,
Thou to me thy secrets tell.
DORCAS
Me too, let me go thither.
MOPSA
Or thou goest to the orange or mill.
DORCAS
If to either, thou dost ill.
AUTOLYCUS
Neither.
DORCAS
What, neither?
AUTOLYCUS
Neither.
DORCAS
Thou hast sworn my love to be.
MOPSA
Thou hast sworn it more to me:
Then whither goest? say, whither?
Clown
We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my
father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll
not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after
me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let's
have the first choice. Follow me, girls.
Exit with DORCAS and MOPSA
