Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half
flayed already.
AUTOLYCUS
Are you in earnest, sir?
Aside

I smell the trick on't.
FLORIZEL
Dispatch, I prithee.
AUTOLYCUS
Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with
conscience take it.
CAMILLO
Unbuckle, unbuckle.
FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments

Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy
Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself
Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat
And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,
Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken
The truth of your own seeming; that you may--
For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard
Get undescried.
PERDITA
I see the play so lies
That I must bear a part.
CAMILLO
No remedy.
Have you done there?
FLORIZEL
Should I now meet my father,
He would not call me son.
CAMILLO
Nay, you shall have no hat.
Giving it to PERDITA

Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.
AUTOLYCUS
Adieu, sir.
FLORIZEL
O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
Pray you, a word.
CAMILLO
[Aside] What I do next, shall be to tell the king
Of this escape and whither they are bound;
Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail
To force him after: in whose company
I shall review Sicilia, for whose sight
I have a woman's longing.
