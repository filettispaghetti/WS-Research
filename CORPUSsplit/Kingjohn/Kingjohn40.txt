And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John.
Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:
And, O, what better matter breeds for you
Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge
Is now in England, ransacking the church,
Offending charity: if but a dozen French
Were there in arms, they would be as a call
To train ten thousand English to their side,
Or as a little snow, tumbled about,
Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,
Go with me to the king: 'tis wonderful
What may be wrought out of their discontent,
Now that their souls are topful of offence.
For England go: I will whet on the king.
LEWIS
Strong reasons make strong actions: let us go:
If you say ay, the king will not say no.
Exeunt

ACT IV

SCENE I. A room in a castle.

Enter HUBERT and Executioners
HUBERT
Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand
Within the arras: when I strike my foot
Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth,
And bind the boy which you shall find with me
Fast to the chair: be heedful: hence, and watch.
First Executioner
I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.
HUBERT
Uncleanly scruples! fear not you: look to't.
Exeunt Executioners

Young lad, come forth; I have to say with you.
Enter ARTHUR

ARTHUR
Good morrow, Hubert.
HUBERT
Good morrow, little prince.
ARTHUR
As little prince, having so great a title
To be more prince, as may be. You are sad.
HUBERT
Indeed, I have been merrier.
ARTHUR
