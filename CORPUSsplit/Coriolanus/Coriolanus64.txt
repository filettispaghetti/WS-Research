What, will he come?
AEdile
He's coming.
BRUTUS
How accompanied?
AEdile
With old Menenius, and those senators
That always favour'd him.
SICINIUS
Have you a catalogue
Of all the voices that we have procured
Set down by the poll?
AEdile
I have; 'tis ready.
SICINIUS
Have you collected them by tribes?
AEdile
I have.
SICINIUS
Assemble presently the people hither;
And when they bear me say 'It shall be so
I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either
For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them
If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'
Insisting on the old prerogative
And power i' the truth o' the cause.
AEdile
I shall inform them.
BRUTUS
And when such time they have begun to cry,
Let them not cease, but with a din confused
Enforce the present execution
Of what we chance to sentence.
AEdile
Very well.
SICINIUS
Make them be strong and ready for this hint,
When we shall hap to give 't them.
BRUTUS
Go about it.
Exit AEdile

Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot
Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks
What's in his heart; and that is there which looks
With us to break his neck.
SICINIUS
Well, here he comes.
