CORIOLANUS
Let them hang.
A Patrician
Ay, and burn too.
Enter MENENIUS and Senators

MENENIUS
Come, come, you have been too rough, something
too rough;
You must return and mend it.
First Senator
There's no remedy;
Unless, by not so doing, our good city

I have a heart as little apt as yours,
But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
To better vantage.

Though therein you can never be too noble,
But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,
Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,

In peace what each of them by the other lose,
That they combine not there.

VOLUMNIA
If it be honour in your wars to seem
