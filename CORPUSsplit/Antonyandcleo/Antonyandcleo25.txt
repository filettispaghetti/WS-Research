For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
By duty ruminated.
MARK ANTONY
Will Caesar speak?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
With what is spoke already.
MARK ANTONY
What power is in Agrippa,
If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'
To make this good?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
The power of Caesar, and
His power unto Octavia.
MARK ANTONY
May I never
To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:
Further this act of grace: and from this hour
The heart of brothers govern in our loves
And sway our great designs!
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
There is my hand.
A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
Did ever love so dearly: let her live
To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never
Fly off our loves again!
LEPIDUS
Happily, amen!
MARK ANTONY
I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;
For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
Of late upon me: I must thank him only,
Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
At heel of that, defy him.
LEPIDUS
Time calls upon's:
Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
Or else he seeks out us.
MARK ANTONY
Where lies he?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
About the mount Misenum.
MARK ANTONY
What is his strength by land?
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Great and increasing: but by sea
He is an absolute master.
MARK ANTONY
So is the fame.
