Both what by sea and land I can be able
To front this present time.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Till which encounter,
It is my business too. Farewell.
LEPIDUS
Farewell, my lord: what you shall know meantime
Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
To let me be partaker.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Doubt not, sir;
I knew it for my bond.
Exeunt

SCENE V. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN
CLEOPATRA
Charmian!
CHARMIAN
Madam?
CLEOPATRA
Ha, ha!
Give me to drink mandragora.
CHARMIAN
Why, madam?
CLEOPATRA
That I might sleep out this great gap of time
My Antony is away.
CHARMIAN
You think of him too much.
CLEOPATRA
O, 'tis treason!
CHARMIAN
Madam, I trust, not so.
CLEOPATRA
Thou, eunuch Mardian!
MARDIAN
What's your highness' pleasure?
CLEOPATRA
Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
In aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee,
That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts
May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?
MARDIAN
Yes, gracious madam.
CLEOPATRA
Indeed!
MARDIAN
Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
