Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master
Will leap to be his friend: for us, you know,
Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar's.
THYREUS
So.
Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats,
Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,
Further than he is Caesar.
CLEOPATRA
Go on: right royal.
THYREUS
He knows that you embrace not Antony
As you did love, but as you fear'd him.
CLEOPATRA
O!
THYREUS
The scars upon your honour, therefore, he
Does pity, as constrained blemishes,
Not as deserved.
CLEOPATRA
He is a god, and knows
What is most right: mine honour was not yielded,
But conquer'd merely.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
[Aside] To be sure of that,
I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky,
That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for
Thy dearest quit thee.
Exit

THYREUS
Shall I say to Caesar
What you require of him? for he partly begs
To be desired to give. It much would please him,
That of his fortunes you should make a staff
To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,
To hear from me you had left Antony,
And put yourself under his shrowd,
The universal landlord.
CLEOPATRA
What's your name?
THYREUS
My name is Thyreus.
CLEOPATRA
Most kind messenger,
Say to great Caesar this: in deputation
I kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am prompt
To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel:
Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear
The doom of Egypt.
