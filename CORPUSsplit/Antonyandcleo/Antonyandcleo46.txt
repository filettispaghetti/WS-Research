To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,
Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
With the green sickness.
AGRIPPA
'Tis a noble Lepidus.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar!
AGRIPPA
Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.
AGRIPPA
What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!
AGRIPPA
O Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar:' go no further.
AGRIPPA
Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony:
Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards,
poets, cannot
Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho!
His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.
AGRIPPA
Both he loves.
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
They are his shards, and he their beetle.
Trumpets within

So;
This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.
AGRIPPA
Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell.
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA

MARK ANTONY
No further, sir.
OCTAVIUS CAESAR
You take from me a great part of myself;
Use me well in 't. Sister, prove such a wife
As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band
Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,
Let not the piece of virtue, which is set
Betwixt us as the cement of our love,
To keep it builded, be the ram to batter
