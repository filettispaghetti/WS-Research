Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.
PROTEUS
My duty will I boast of; nothing else.
SILVIA
And duty never yet did want his meed:
Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.
PROTEUS
I'll die on him that says so but yourself.
SILVIA
That you are welcome?
PROTEUS
That you are worthless.
Re-enter THURIO

THURIO
Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.
SILVIA
I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,
Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome:
I'll leave you to confer of home affairs;
When you have done, we look to hear from you.
PROTEUS
We'll both attend upon your ladyship.
Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO

VALENTINE
Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
PROTEUS
Your friends are well and have them much commended.
VALENTINE
And how do yours?
PROTEUS
I left them all in health.
VALENTINE
How does your lady? and how thrives your love?
PROTEUS
My tales of love were wont to weary you;
I know you joy not in a love discourse.
VALENTINE
Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now:
I have done penance for contemning Love,
Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,
With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;
For in revenge of my contempt of love,
Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.
O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,
And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,
There is no woe to his correction,
