That may discover such integrity:
For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,
Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,
Make tigers tame and huge leviathans
Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
After your dire-lamenting elegies,
Visit by night your lady's chamber-window
With some sweet concert; to their instruments
Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence
Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.
This, or else nothing, will inherit her.
DUKE
This discipline shows thou hast been in love.
THURIO
And thy advice this night I'll put in practise.
Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,
Let us into the city presently
To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.
I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
To give the onset to thy good advice.
DUKE
About it, gentlemen!
PROTEUS
We'll wait upon your grace till after supper,
And afterward determine our proceedings.
DUKE
Even now about it! I will pardon you.
Exeunt

ACT IV

SCENE I. The frontiers of Mantua. A forest.

Enter certain Outlaws
First Outlaw
Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.
Second Outlaw
If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em.
Enter VALENTINE and SPEED

Third Outlaw
Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye:
If not: we'll make you sit and rifle you.
SPEED
Sir, we are undone; these are the villains
That all the travellers do fear so much.
VALENTINE
My friends,--
First Outlaw
That's not so, sir: we are your enemies.
