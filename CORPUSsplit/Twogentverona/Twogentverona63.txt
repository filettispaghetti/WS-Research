Enter Outlaws with SILVIA
First Outlaw
Come, come,
Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.
SILVIA
A thousand more mischances than this one
Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.
Second Outlaw
Come, bring her away.
First Outlaw
Where is the gentleman that was with her?
Third Outlaw
Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,
But Moyses and Valerius follow him.
Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;
There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled;
The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape.
First Outlaw
Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave:
Fear not; he bears an honourable mind,
And will not use a woman lawlessly.
SILVIA
O Valentine, this I endure for thee!
Exeunt

SCENE IV. Another part of the forest.

Enter VALENTINE
VALENTINE
How use doth breed a habit in a man!
This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,
I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:
Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
And to the nightingale's complaining notes
Tune my distresses and record my woes.
O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,
Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall
And leave no memory of what it was!
Repair me with thy presence, Silvia;
Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!
What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
These are my mates, that make their wills their law,
Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
They love me well; yet I have much to do
To keep them from uncivil outrages.
Withdraw thee, Valentine: who's this comes here?
Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIA
