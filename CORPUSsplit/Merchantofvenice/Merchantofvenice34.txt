honest Antonio,--O that I had a title good enough
to keep his name company!--
SALARINO
Come, the full stop.
SALANIO
Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath
lost a ship.
SALARINO
I would it might prove the end of his losses.
SALANIO
Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross my
prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.
Enter SHYLOCK

How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?
SHYLOCK
You know, none so well, none so well as you, of my
daughter's flight.
SALARINO
That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor
that made the wings she flew withal.
SALANIO
And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was
fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all
to leave the dam.
SHYLOCK
She is damned for it.
SALANIO
That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.
SHYLOCK
My own flesh and blood to rebel!
SALANIO
Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years?
SHYLOCK
I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.
SALARINO
There is more difference between thy flesh and hers
than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods
than there is between red wine and rhenish. But
tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any
loss at sea or no?
SHYLOCK
There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a
prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the
Rialto; a beggar, that was used to come so smug upon
the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to
call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was
wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him
look to his bond.
SALARINO
