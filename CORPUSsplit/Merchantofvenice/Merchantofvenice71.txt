I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.
NERISSA
And I his clerk; therefore be well advised
How you do leave me to mine own protection.
GRATIANO
Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;
For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.
ANTONIO
I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.
PORTIA
Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.
BASSANIO
Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
And, in the hearing of these many friends,
I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
Wherein I see myself--
PORTIA
Mark you but that!
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;
In each eye, one: swear by your double self,
And there's an oath of credit.
BASSANIO
Nay, but hear me:
Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
I never more will break an oath with thee.
ANTONIO
I once did lend my body for his wealth;
Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,
Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,
My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
Will never more break faith advisedly.
PORTIA
Then you shall be his surety. Give him this
And bid him keep it better than the other.
ANTONIO
Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.
BASSANIO
By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
PORTIA
I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;
For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.
NERISSA
And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;
For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,
In lieu of this last night did lie with me.
GRATIANO
Why, this is like the mending of highways
In summer, where the ways are fair enough:
What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?
PORTIA
