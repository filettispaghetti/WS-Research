When the one pure, the other made divine?
Whose love of either to myself was nearer
When both were kept for heaven and Collatine?
Ay me, the bark pilled from the lofty pine,
  His leaves will wither and his sap decay;
  So must my soul, her bark being pilled away.

"Her house is sacked, her quiet interrupted,
Her mansion battered by the enemy,
Her sacred temple spotted, spoiled, corrupted,
Grossly engirt with daring infamy.
Then let it not be called impiety
  If in this blemished fort I make some hole
  Through which I may convey this troubled soul.

"Yet die I will not till my Collatine
Have heard the cause of my untimely death,
That he may vow, in that sad hour of mine,
Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
My stained blood to Tarquin I'll bequeath,
  Which, by him tainted, shall for him be spent,
  And as his due writ in my testament.

"My honor I'll bequeath unto the knife
That wounds my body so dishonored.
'Tis honor to deprive dishonored life;
The one will live, the other being dead.
So of shame's ashes shall my fame be bred,
  For in my death I murder shameful scorn;
  My shame so dead, mine honor is new born.

"Dear lord of that dear jewel I have lost,
What legacy shall I bequeath to thee?
My resolution, love, shall be thy boast,
By whose example thou revenged mayst be.
How Tarquin must be used, read it in me;
  Myself, thy friend, will kill myself, thy foe,
  And for my sake serve thou false Tarquin so.

"This brief abridgement of my will I make:
My soul and body to the skies and ground;
My resolution, husband, do thou take;
Mine honor be the knife's that makes my wound;
My shame be his that did my fame confound;
  And all my fame that lives disbursed be
  To those that live and think no shame of me.

"Thou, Collatine, shalt oversee this will;
How was I overseen that thou shalt see it!
My blood shall wash the slander of mine ill;
