THAISA
He thanks your grace; names himself Pericles,
A gentleman of Tyre,
Who only by misfortune of the seas
Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.
SIMONIDES
Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune,
And will awake him from his melancholy.
Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,
And waste the time, which looks for other revels.
Even in your armours, as you are address'd,
Will very well become a soldier's dance.
I will not have excuse, with saying this
Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,
Since they love men in arms as well as beds.
The Knights dance

So, this was well ask'd,'twas so well perform'd.
Come, sir;
Here is a lady that wants breathing too:
And I have heard, you knights of Tyre
Are excellent in making ladies trip;
And that their measures are as excellent.
PERICLES
In those that practise them they are, my lord.
SIMONIDES
O, that's as much as you would be denied
Of your fair courtesy.
The Knights and Ladies dance

Unclasp, unclasp:
Thanks, gentlemen, to all; all have done well.
To PERICLES

But you the best. Pages and lights, to conduct
These knights unto their several lodgings!
To PERICLES

Yours, sir,
We have given order to be next our own.
PERICLES
I am at your grace's pleasure.
SIMONIDES
Princes, it is too late to talk of love;
And that's the mark I know you level at:
Therefore each one betake him to his rest;
To-morrow all for speeding do their best.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. Tyre. A room in the Governor's house.
