LYSIMACHUS
That dignifies the renown of a bawd, no less than it
gives a good report to a number to be chaste.
Exit BOULT

Bawd
Here comes that which grows to the stalk; never
plucked yet, I can assure you.
Re-enter BOULT with MARINA

Is she not a fair creature?
LYSIMACHUS
'Faith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea.
Well, there's for you: leave us.
Bawd
I beseech your honour, give me leave: a word, and
I'll have done presently.
LYSIMACHUS
I beseech you, do.
Bawd
[To MARINA] First, I would have you note, this is
an honourable man.
MARINA
I desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him.
Bawd
Next, he's the governor of this country, and a man
whom I am bound to.
MARINA
If he govern the country, you are bound to him
indeed; but how honourable he is in that, I know not.
Bawd
Pray you, without any more virginal fencing, will
you use him kindly? He will line your apron with gold.
MARINA
What he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive.
LYSIMACHUS
Ha' you done?
Bawd
My lord, she's not paced yet: you must take some
pains to work her to your manage. Come, we will
leave his honour and her together. Go thy ways.
Exeunt Bawd, Pandar, and BOULT

LYSIMACHUS
Now, pretty one, how long have you been at this trade?
MARINA
What trade, sir?
LYSIMACHUS
Why, I cannot name't but I shall offend.
MARINA
