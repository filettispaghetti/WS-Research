Unless your thoughts went on my way.
Dionyza does appear,
With Leonine, a murderer.
Exit

SCENE I. Tarsus. An open place near the sea-shore.

Enter DIONYZA and LEONINE
DIONYZA
Thy oath remember; thou hast sworn to do't:
'Tis but a blow, which never shall be known.
Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon,
To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,
Which is but cold, inflaming love i' thy bosom,
Inflame too nicely; nor let pity, which
Even women have cast off, melt thee, but be
A soldier to thy purpose.
LEONINE
I will do't; but yet she is a goodly creature.
DIONYZA
The fitter, then, the gods should have her. Here
she comes weeping for her only mistress' death.
Thou art resolved?
LEONINE
I am resolved.
Enter MARINA, with a basket of flowers

MARINA
No, I will rob Tellus of her weed,
To strew thy green with flowers: the yellows, blues,
The purple violets, and marigolds,
Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,
While summer-days do last. Ay me! poor maid,
Born in a tempest, when my mother died,
This world to me is like a lasting storm,
Whirring me from my friends.
DIONYZA
How now, Marina! why do you keep alone?
How chance my daughter is not with you? Do not
Consume your blood with sorrowing: you have
A nurse of me. Lord, how your favour's changed
With this unprofitable woe!
Come, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.
Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there,
And it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come,
Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her.
MARINA
No, I pray you;
I'll not bereave you of your servant.
DIONYZA
