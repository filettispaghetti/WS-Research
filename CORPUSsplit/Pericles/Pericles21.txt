THAISA
A knight of Sparta, my renowned father;
And the device he bears upon his shield
Is a black Ethiope reaching at the sun
The word, 'Lux tua vita mihi.'
SIMONIDES
He loves you well that holds his life of you.
The Second Knight passes over

Who is the second that presents himself?
THAISA
A prince of Macedon, my royal father;
And the device he bears upon his shield
Is an arm'd knight that's conquer'd by a lady;
The motto thus, in Spanish, 'Piu por dulzura que por fuerza.'
The Third Knight passes over

SIMONIDES
And what's the third?
THAISA
The third of Antioch;
And his device, a wreath of chivalry;
The word, 'Me pompae provexit apex.'
The Fourth Knight passes over

SIMONIDES
What is the fourth?
THAISA
A burning torch that's turned upside down;
The word, 'Quod me alit, me extinguit.'
SIMONIDES
Which shows that beauty hath his power and will,
Which can as well inflame as it can kill.
The Fifth Knight passes over

THAISA
The fifth, an hand environed with clouds,
Holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried;
The motto thus, 'Sic spectanda fides.'
The Sixth Knight, PERICLES, passes over

SIMONIDES
And what's
The sixth and last, the which the knight himself
With such a graceful courtesy deliver'd?
THAISA
He seems to be a stranger; but his present is
A wither'd branch, that's only green at top;
The motto, 'In hac spe vivo.'
SIMONIDES
