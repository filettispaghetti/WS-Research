
ARCITE  Not far, sir.
Are there such games today?

FIRST COUNTRYMAN  Yes, marry, are there,
And such as you never saw. The Duke himself
Will be in person there.

SECOND COUNTRYMAN

THIRD COUNTRYMAN
Thou wilt not go along?

ARCITE  Not yet, sir.

FOURTH COUNTRYMAN  Well, sir,
Take your own time.--Come, boys.

FIRST COUNTRYMAN, [aside to the others]  My mind misgives
me. This fellow has a vengeance trick o' th'
hip. Mark how his body's made for 't.

SECOND COUNTRYMAN, [aside to the others]  I'll be
hanged, though, if he dare venture. Hang him,
plum porridge! He wrestle? He roast eggs! Come,
let's be gone, lads.	[The four exit.]

ARCITE
This is an offered opportunity
I durst not wish for. Well I could have wrestled--
The best men called it excellent--and run
Swifter than wind upon a field of corn,
Curling the wealthy ears, never flew. I'll venture,
And in some poor disguise be there. Who knows
Whether my brows may not be girt with garlands,
And happiness prefer me to a place
Where I may ever dwell in sight of her?
