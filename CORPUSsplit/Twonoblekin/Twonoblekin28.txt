told me
That I was Palamon and you were Arcite.

PALAMON
Yes.

ARCITE  Am not I liable to those affections,
Those joys, griefs, angers, fears, my friend shall
suffer?

PALAMON
You may be.

ARCITE  Why then would you deal so cunningly,
So strangely, so unlike a noble kinsman,
To love alone? Speak truly, do you think me
Unworthy of her sight?

PALAMON  No, but unjust
If thou pursue that sight.

ARCITE  Because another
First sees the enemy, shall I stand still
And let mine honor down, and never charge?

PALAMON
Yes, if he be but one.

ARCITE  But say that one
Had rather combat me?

PALAMON  Let that one say so,
And use thy freedom. Else, if thou pursuest her,
Be as that cursed man that hates his country,
A branded villain.

ARCITE  You are mad.

PALAMON  I must be.
Till thou art worthy, Arcite, it concerns me.
And in this madness if I hazard thee
And take thy life, I deal but truly.

ARCITE  Fie, sir!
You play the child extremely. I will love her;
I must, I ought to do so, and I dare,
And all this justly.

PALAMON  O, that now, that now,
Thy false self and thy friend had but this fortune
