PALAMON  By this good light,
Had I a sword I would kill thee.

JAILER  Why, my lord?

PALAMON
Thou bringst such pelting, scurvy news continually,
Thou art not worthy life. I will not go.

JAILER
Indeed you must, my lord.

PALAMON  May I see the garden?

JAILER
No.

PALAMON  Then I am resolved, I will not go.

JAILER
I must constrain you then; and, for you are
dangerous,
I'll clap more irons on you.

PALAMON  Do, good keeper.
I'll shake 'em so, you shall not sleep;
I'll make you a new morris. Must I go?

JAILER
There is no remedy.

PALAMON  Farewell, kind window.
May rude wind never hurt thee. O, my lady,
If ever thou hast felt what sorrow was,
Dream how I suffer.--Come; now bury me.

Scene 3
=======
[Enter Arcite.]


ARCITE
Banished the kingdom? 'Tis a benefit,
A mercy I must thank 'em for; but banished
The free enjoying of that face I die for,
O, 'twas a studied punishment, a death
Beyond imagination--such a vengeance
That, were I old and wicked, all my sins
Could never pluck upon me. Palamon,
