DAUGHTER, [to Jailer]  Come hither; you are a wise

FIRST FRIEND, [aside]  Does she know him?

SECOND FRIEND  No; would she did.

JAILER  Yes.

DAUGHTER  Where's your compass?

JAILER  Here.

DAUGHTER  Set it to th' north. And now direct your

my hearts, cheerly.

ALL, [as if sailing a ship]  Owgh, owgh, owgh!--'Tis up!
The wind's fair!--Top the bowline!--Out with the
main sail! Where's your whistle, master?

BROTHER  Let's get her in!

JAILER  Up to the top, boy!

BROTHER  Where's the pilot?

FIRST FRIEND  Here.

DAUGHTER  What kenn'st thou?

SECOND FRIEND  A fair wood.

DAUGHTER  Bear for it, master. Tack about!
