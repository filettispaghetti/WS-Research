
JAILER  They are famed to be a pair of absolute men.

DAUGHTER  By my troth, I think fame but stammers
'em. They stand a grise above the reach of report.

JAILER  I heard them reported in the battle to be the
only doers.

DAUGHTER  Nay, most likely, for they are noble suff'rers.
I marvel how they would have looked had they
been victors, that with such a constant nobility enforce
a freedom out of bondage, making misery
their mirth and affliction a toy to jest at.

JAILER  Do they so?

DAUGHTER  It seems to me they have no more sense
of their captivity than I of ruling Athens. They eat
well, look merrily, discourse of many things, but
nothing of their own restraint and disasters. Yet
sometimes a divided sigh, martyred as 'twere i' th'
deliverance, will break from one of them--when
the other presently gives it so sweet a rebuke that
I could wish myself a sigh to be so chid, or at least
a sigher to be comforted.

WOOER  I never saw 'em.

JAILER  The Duke himself came privately in the night,
and so did they.

[Enter Palamon and Arcite, in shackles, above.]

What the reason of it is, I know not. Look, yonder
they are; that's Arcite looks out.

DAUGHTER  No, sir, no, that's Palamon. Arcite is the
lower of the twain; you may perceive a part of
him.

JAILER  Go to, leave your pointing; they would not
make us their object. Out of their sight.

DAUGHTER  It is a holiday to look on them. Lord, the
diff'rence of men!
[Jailer, Daughter, and Wooer exit.]
