
SCHOOLMASTER  Dii boni! A tinker, damsel?

DAUGHTER  Or a conjurer. Raise me a devil now, and let
him play Chi passa o' th' bells and bones.

SCHOOLMASTER  Go, take her, and fluently persuade her
to a peace. Et opus exegi, quod nec Iovis ira, nec
ignis. Strike up, and lead her in.

SECOND COUNTRYMAN  Come, lass, let's trip it.

DAUGHTER  I'll lead.

THIRD COUNTRYMAN  Do, do!

SCHOOLMASTER  Persuasively, and cunningly.
[Wind horns.]
Away, boys! I hear the horns. Give me some
meditation, and mark your cue.
[All but Schoolmaster exit.]
Pallas, inspire me!

[Enter Theseus, Pirithous, Hippolyta, Emilia, and train.]


THESEUS  This way the stag took.

SCHOOLMASTER  Stay, and edify!

THESEUS  What have we here?

PIRITHOUS  Some country sport, upon my life, sir.

THESEUS, [to Schoolmaster]  Well, sir, go forward. We
will "edify."	[Chairs and stools brought out.]
Ladies, sit down. We'll stay it.
[Theseus, Hippolyta, and Emilia sit.]

SCHOOLMASTER
Thou doughty duke, all hail!--All hail, sweet ladies!

THESEUS, [aside]  This is a cold beginning.

SCHOOLMASTER
If you but favor, our country pastime made is.
We are a few of those collected here
That ruder tongues distinguish "villager."
And to say verity, and not to fable,
We are a merry rout, or else a rabble,
