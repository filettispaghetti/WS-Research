Shall be no shelter to these outrages:
But he and his shall know that justice lives
In Saturninus' health, whom, if she sleep,
He'll so awake as she in fury shall
Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.
TAMORA
My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,
Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,
Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,
The effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,
Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarr'd his heart;
And rather comfort his distressed plight
Than prosecute the meanest or the best
For these contempts.
Aside

Why, thus it shall become
High-witted Tamora to gloze with all:
But, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick,
Thy life-blood out: if Aaron now be wise,
Then is all safe, the anchor's in the port.
Enter Clown

How now, good fellow! wouldst thou speak with us?
Clown
Yea, forsooth, an your mistership be emperial.
TAMORA
Empress I am, but yonder sits the emperor.
Clown
'Tis he. God and Saint Stephen give you good den:
I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.
SATURNINUS reads the letter

SATURNINUS
Go, take him away, and hang him presently.
Clown
How much money must I have?
TAMORA
Come, sirrah, you must be hanged.
Clown
Hanged! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to
a fair end.
Exit, guarded

SATURNINUS
Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
Shall I endure this monstrous villany?
I know from whence this same device proceeds:
May this be borne?--as if his traitorous sons,
That died by law for murder of our brother,
