Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go;
Ransomless here we set our prisoners free:
Proclaim our honours, lords, with trump and drum.
Flourish. SATURNINUS courts TAMORA in dumb show

BASSIANUS
Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.
Seizing LAVINIA

TITUS ANDRONICUS
How, sir! are you in earnest then, my lord?
BASSIANUS
Ay, noble Titus; and resolved withal
To do myself this reason and this right.
MARCUS ANDRONICUS
'Suum cuique' is our Roman justice:
This prince in justice seizeth but his own.
LUCIUS
And that he will, and shall, if Lucius live.
TITUS ANDRONICUS
Traitors, avaunt! Where is the emperor's guard?
Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised!
SATURNINUS
Surprised! by whom?
BASSIANUS
By him that justly may
Bear his betroth'd from all the world away.
Exeunt BASSIANUS and MARCUS with LAVINIA

MUTIUS
Brothers, help to convey her hence away,
And with my sword I'll keep this door safe.
Exeunt LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS

TITUS ANDRONICUS
Follow, my lord, and I'll soon bring her back.
MUTIUS
My lord, you pass not here.
TITUS ANDRONICUS
What, villain boy!
Barr'st me my way in Rome?
Stabbing MUTIUS

MUTIUS
Help, Lucius, help!
Dies

During the fray, SATURNINUS, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON and AARON go out and re-enter, above

Re-enter LUCIUS
