and that our Sauiour Christ saith,
None can enter into the kingdome of
God, except hee bee regenerate, and
borne anew of water and of the Holy
Gost: I beseech you to call vpon God
the Father, through our lord Jesu#
Christ, that of hi# bounteou# mercie,
hee will grant to these children, that
thing which by nature they cannot haue, that they may be
baptized with water and the holy Ghost, and receiued into
Christ# holy Church, and be made liuely member# of the same.
Then ſhall the Prie ſay.
¶ Let v# praye.
Lmightie and euerlasting GOD, whiche of thy
great mercie diddest saue Noe and hi# familie in
the Arcke, from perishing by water, and also diddest
safely lead the children of Israel, thy people,
throrow the Red Sea, figuring therby thy holy
Baptisme: and by the Baptisme of thy welbeloued Son Jesu#
Christ, diddest sanctifie the flood Jordan, and all other water#,
to the mysticall washing away of sinne: We beseech thee for
thine infinite mercie#, that thou wilt mercifully look vpon these
children, sanctifie them and wash them with thy holy Gost, that
they being deliuered from thy wrath, may bee receiued into the
Arcke of Christ# Church, and being stedfast in faith, ioyfull
through hope, and rooted in charitie, may so passe the waue#
of thi# troublesome world, that finally they may come to the
land of euerlasting life, there to reigne with thee world without
end, through Jesu# Christ our Lorde. Amen.
Lmighty and immortall God, the aide of all that
neede, the helper of all that flee to thee for succour,
the life of them that beleeue, and the resurrection
of the dead: wee call vpon thee for these
Infant#, that they comming to thy holy Baptisme,
may receiue remission of their sinne# by spirituall regeneracion.
Receiue them (O Lord) a# thou hast promised by thy 
welbeloued Sonne, saying: Aske and you shall haue; seeke,
and you shall finde: knocke and it shall bee opened vnto you:
So giue now vnto v# that aske. Let v# that seeke, finde open
the gate vnto v# that knocke, that these Infante# may enioy the
euerlasting benediction of thy heauenly washing, and may come
to the eternall Kingdome which thou hast promised by Christ
our Lord. Amen.
¶ Then all the Prie ſaye
Heare the word# of the Gospel, written by S. Marke,
in the tenth Chapter.
T a certaine time they brought children to Christ
that hee should touch them, and hi# Disciple# rebuked
those that brought them. But when Jesu#
saw it, he wa# displeased, and said vnto them.
