and shall be ioyned vnto hi# wife, and they two shall be one
flesh. Thi# misterie i# great : but I speake of Christ and of the
Congregation. Neuerthelesse, let euery one of you so loue hi#
owne wife, euen a# himselfe.
Likewise the same Saint Paul writing to the Collossian#,
speaketh thu# to all men that be married. Ye men, loue your
wyue#, and be not bitter vnto them.
Colo. 3.
Heare also what S. Peter the apostle of Christ, which wa#
himselfe a married man, saith vnto them that are married, Yee
husband#, dwell with your wyue# according to knowledge,
giuing honour vnto the wife a# vnto the weaker vessell, and a#
heire# together of the grace of life, so that your prayer# be not
hindred.
1. Pet. 3.
Hetherto yee haue heard the duety of the husband toward
the wife. Now likewise yee wiue#, heare and learne your duetie#
toward your husband#, euen a# it i# plainely set forth in
holy Scripture.
S. Paul in the aforenamed Epistle to the Ephesian#, teacheth
you thu#: Ye women, submit your selue# vnto your owne
husband# a# vnto the Lord. For the husband i# the wiue#
head, euen a# Christ i# the head of the Church, and he i# also
the Sauiour of the whole body.
Epheſ. 5.
Therefore a# the Church or Congregation, i# subiect vnto
Christ: so likewise let the wiue# also be in subiection vnto their
owne husband# in all thing#. And againe he saith, Let the
wife reuerence her husband. And in hi# Epistle to the Collossian#,
S. Paule giueth you thi# short lesson, Ye wiue#, submit
your selue# vnto your owne husband#, a# it i# conuenient in
the Lord.
Saint Peter also doeth instruct you very godly, thu# saying,
Let wyue# be subiect to their owne husband#, so that if any
obey not the word, they may bee wonne withoute the word, by
the conuersation of the wiue#, while they behold your chaste
conuersation coupled with feare. Whose apparell let it not bee 
outward, with braided haire and trimming about with gold,
either in putting on of gorgeous# apparell, but let the hid man
which i# in the heart, be without all corruption, so that the
spirit be milde and quiet, which i# a precious# thing in the
sight of God. For after thi# maner in the old time did the holy
women which trusted in GOD apparell themselues#, being
subiect to their owne husband#, a# Sara obeyed Abraham
calling him lord, whose daughter# yee are made, doing well,
and being not dismayed with any feare.
¶ The new married perſons, the same day of their mariage, must receiue
the holy Communion.
