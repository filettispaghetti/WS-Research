Bible, ſaying.
Iue heed vnto reading, exho°tation and doctrine. Thinke vpon
theƒe things contained in this booke. Be diligent in them, that
the increaƒe comming thereby, may be manife¥ vnto all men. Take
heed vnto thyƒelfe, and vnto teaching, and be diligent in doing them:

O¥ merciful Father, we beƒeech thee, to ƒend down vpon this

to rep°ooue, beƒeech, and rebuke, with all patience and doctrine, but
alƒo may bee, to ƒuch as beleeue, an wholƒome example in wo°d, in
conuersation, in loue, in faith, in cha¥itie, and puritie, that faithfully
fulfilling his courƒe, at the latter day hee may receiue the Crowne of righteouƒne±e, laid vp by the Lo°d the righteous Judge, who liueth and reigneth,
one God with the Father and holy Gho¥, wo°ld without end.
Amen.
