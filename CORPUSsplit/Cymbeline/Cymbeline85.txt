A father to me; and thou hast created
A mother and two brothers: but, O scorn!
Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:
And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend
On greatness' favour dream as I have done,
Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve:
Many dream not to find, neither deserve,
And yet are steep'd in favours: so am I,
That have this golden chance and know not why.
What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!
Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment
Nobler than that it covers: let thy effects
So follow, to be most unlike our courtiers,
As good as promise.

As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,
The action of my life is like it, which
I'll keep, if but for sympathy.

Come, sir, are you ready for death?
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.
First Gaoler
Hanging is the word, sir: if
you be ready for that, you are well cooked.
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
So, if I prove a good repast to the
spectators, the dish pays the shot.
First Gaoler
A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is,
you shall be called to no more payments, fear no
more tavern-bills; which are often the sadness of
parting, as the procuring of mirth: you come in
flint for want of meat, depart reeling with too
much drink; sorry that you have paid too much, and
sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain
both empty; the brain the heavier for being too
