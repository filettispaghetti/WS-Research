
"No, no," quoth she, "sweet Death, I did but jest.
Yet pardon me, I felt a kind of fear
Whenas I met the boar, that bloody beast,
Which knows no pity but is still severe.
  Then, gentle shadow--truth I must confess--
  I railed on thee, fearing my love's decease.

"'Tis not my fault; the boar provoked my tongue.
Be wreaked on him, invisible commander.
'Tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong;
I did but act, he's author of thy slander.
  Grief hath two tongues, and never woman yet
  Could rule them both without ten women's wit."

Thus hoping that Adonis is alive,
Her rash suspect she doth extenuate,
And that his beauty may the better thrive,
With Death she humbly doth insinuate,
  Tells him of trophies, statues, tombs, and stories,
  His victories, his triumphs, and his glories.

"O Jove," quoth she, "how much a fool was I
To be of such a weak and silly mind
To wail his death who lives and must not die
Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind!
  For, he being dead, with him is beauty slain,
  And, beauty dead, black chaos comes again.

"Fie, fie, fond Love, thou art as full of fear
As one with treasure laden, hemmed with thieves;
Trifles unwitnessed with eye or ear
Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves."
  Even at this word she hears a merry horn,
  Whereat she leaps, that was but late forlorn.

As falcons to the lure, away she flies--
The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light--
And in her haste unfortunately spies
The foul boar's conquest on her fair delight,
  Which seen, her eyes, as murdered with the view,
  Like stars ashamed of day, themselves withdrew;

Or as the snail, whose tender horns being hit,
Shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain
And there, all smothered up, in shade doth sit,
Long after fearing to creep forth again;
  So at his bloody view her eyes are fled
  Into the deep-dark cabins of her head,
