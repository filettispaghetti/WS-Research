Where's the fool now?
APEMANTUS
He last asked the question. Poor rogues, and
usurers' men! bawds between gold and want!
All Servants
What are we, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS
Asses.
All Servants
Why?
APEMANTUS
That you ask me what you are, and do not know
yourselves. Speak to 'em, fool.
Fool
How do you, gentlemen?
All Servants
Gramercies, good fool: how does your mistress?
Fool
She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens
as you are. Would we could see you at Corinth!
APEMANTUS
Good! gramercy.

Look you, here comes my mistress' page.

[To the Fool] Why, how now, captain! what do you
in this wise company? How dost thou, Apemantus?
APEMANTUS
Would I had a rod in my mouth, that I might answer
thee profitably.
Page
Prithee, Apemantus, read me the superscription of
these letters: I know not which is which.
APEMANTUS
Canst not read?
Page
No.
APEMANTUS
There will little learning die then, that day thou
art hanged. This is to Lord Timon; this to
Alcibiades. Go; thou wast born a bastard, and thou't
die a bawd.

Thou wast whelped a dog, and thou shalt famish a
dog's death. Answer not; I am gone.
