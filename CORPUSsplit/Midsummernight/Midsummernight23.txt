No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.
SNOUT
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
STARVELING
I fear it, I promise you.
BOTTOM
Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to
bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a
most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful

another thing: we must have a wall in the great
chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did

BOTTOM
Some man or other must present Wall: and let him
