I go of message from the queen to France;
I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel.
Captain
Walter,--
WHITMORE
Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.
SUFFOLK
Gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee I fear.
WHITMORE
Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.
What, are ye daunted now? now will ye stoop?
First Gentleman
My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.
SUFFOLK
Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough,
Used to command, untaught to plead for favour.
Far be it we should honour such as these
With humble suit: no, rather let my head
Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
Save to the God of heaven and to my king;
And sooner dance upon a bloody pole
Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom.
True nobility is exempt from fear:
More can I bear than you dare execute.
Captain
Hale him away, and let him talk no more.
SUFFOLK
Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,
That this my death may never be forgot!
Great men oft die by vile bezonians:
A Roman sworder and banditto slave
Murder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard hand
Stabb'd Julius Caesar; savage islanders
Pompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates.
Exeunt Whitmore and others with Suffolk

Captain
And as for these whose ransom we have set,
It is our pleasure one of them depart;
Therefore come you with us and let him go.
Exeunt all but the First Gentleman

Re-enter WHITMORE with SUFFOLK's body

WHITMORE
There let his head and lifeless body lie,
Until the queen his mistress bury it.
Exit

First Gentleman
