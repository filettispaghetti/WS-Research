Hath he conversed with the enemy,
And undiscover'd come to me again
And given me notice of their villanies.
This devil here shall be my substitute;
For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,
In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble:
By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,
How they affect the house and claim of York.
Say he be taken, rack'd and tortured,
I know no pain they can inflict upon him
Will make him say I moved him to those arms.
Say that he thrive, as 'tis great like he will,
Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength
And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;
For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,
And Henry put apart, the next for me.
Exit

SCENE II. Bury St. Edmund's. A room of state.

Enter certain Murderers, hastily
First Murderer
Run to my Lord of Suffolk; let him know
We have dispatch'd the duke, as he commanded.
Second Murderer
O that it were to do! What have we done?
Didst ever hear a man so penitent?
Enter SUFFOLK

First Murder
Here comes my lord.
SUFFOLK
Now, sirs, have you dispatch'd this thing?
First Murderer
Ay, my good lord, he's dead.
SUFFOLK
Why, that's well said. Go, get you to my house;
I will reward you for this venturous deed.
The king and all the peers are here at hand.
Have you laid fair the bed? Is all things well,
According as I gave directions?
First Murderer
'Tis, my good lord.
SUFFOLK
Away! be gone.
Exeunt Murderers
