praise him.
Servant
The lord be praised!
PANDARUS
You know me, do you not?
Servant
Faith, sir, superficially.
PANDARUS
Friend, know me better; I am the Lord Pandarus.
Servant
I hope I shall know your honour better.
PANDARUS
I do desire it.
Servant
You are in the state of grace.
PANDARUS
Grace! not so, friend: honour and lordship are my titles.
Music within

What music is this?
Servant
I do but partly know, sir: it is music in parts.
PANDARUS
Know you the musicians?
Servant
Wholly, sir.
PANDARUS
Who play they to?
Servant
To the hearers, sir.
PANDARUS
At whose pleasure, friend
Servant
At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.
PANDARUS
Command, I mean, friend.
Servant
Who shall I command, sir?
PANDARUS
Friend, we understand not one another: I am too
courtly and thou art too cunning. At whose request
do these men play?
Servant
That's to 't indeed, sir: marry, sir, at the request
of Paris my lord, who's there in person; with him,
the mortal Venus, the heart-blood of beauty, love's
invisible soul,--
PANDARUS
Who, my cousin Cressida?
Servant
