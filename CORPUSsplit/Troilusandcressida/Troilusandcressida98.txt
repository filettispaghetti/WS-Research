AJAX
Were I the general, thou shouldst have my office
Ere that correction. Troilus, I say! what, Troilus!
Enter TROILUS

TROILUS
O traitor Diomed! turn thy false face, thou traitor,
And pay thy life thou owest me for my horse!
DIOMEDES
Ha, art thou there?
AJAX
I'll fight with him alone: stand, Diomed.
DIOMEDES
He is my prize; I will not look upon.
TROILUS
Come, both you cogging Greeks; have at you both!
Exeunt, fighting

Enter HECTOR

HECTOR
Yea, Troilus? O, well fought, my youngest brother!
Enter ACHILLES

ACHILLES
Now do I see thee, ha! have at thee, Hector!
HECTOR
Pause, if thou wilt.
ACHILLES
I do disdain thy courtesy, proud Trojan:
Be happy that my arms are out of use:
My rest and negligence befriends thee now,
But thou anon shalt hear of me again;
Till when, go seek thy fortune.
Exit

HECTOR
Fare thee well:
I would have been much more a fresher man,
Had I expected thee. How now, my brother!
Re-enter TROILUS

TROILUS
Ajax hath ta'en AEneas: shall it be?
No, by the flame of yonder glorious heaven,
He shall not carry him: I'll be ta'en too,
Or bring him off: fate, hear me what I say!
I reck not though I end my life to-day.
Exit
