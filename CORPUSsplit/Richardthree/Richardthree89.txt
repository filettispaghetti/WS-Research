Enter RATCLIFF; CATESBY following

How now! what news?
RATCLIFF
My gracious sovereign, on the western coast
Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
And there they hull, expecting but the aid
Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.
KING RICHARD III
Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:
Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?
CATESBY
Here, my lord.
KING RICHARD III
Fly to the duke:
To RATCLIFF

Post thou to Salisbury
When thou comest thither--
To CATESBY

Dull, unmindful villain,
Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke?
CATESBY
First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,
What from your grace I shall deliver to him.
KING RICHARD III
O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight
The greatest strength and power he can make,
And meet me presently at Salisbury.
CATESBY
I go.
Exit

RATCLIFF
What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at
Salisbury?
KING RICHARD III
Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?
RATCLIFF
Your highness told me I should post before.
KING RICHARD III
My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed.
