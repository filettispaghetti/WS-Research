'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.'
Enter OXFORD, with drum and colours

WARWICK
O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
OXFORD
Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!
He and his forces enter the city

GLOUCESTER
The gates are open, let us enter too.
KING EDWARD IV
So other foes may set upon our backs.
Stand we in good array; for they no doubt
Will issue out again and bid us battle:
If not, the city being but of small defence,
We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.
WARWICK
O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.
Enter MONTAGUE with drum and colours

MONTAGUE
Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!
He and his forces enter the city

GLOUCESTER
Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.
KING EDWARD IV
The harder match'd, the greater victory:
My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.
Enter SOMERSET, with drum and colours

SOMERSET
Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!
He and his forces enter the city

GLOUCESTER
Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,
Have sold their lives unto the house of York;
And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.
Enter CLARENCE, with drum and colours

WARWICK
And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,
Of force enough to bid his brother battle;
With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
More than the nature of a brother's love!
Come, Clarence, come; thou wilt, if Warwick call.
CLARENCE
