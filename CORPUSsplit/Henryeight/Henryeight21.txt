Chamberlain
I will, my lord.
Whispers the Masquers

CARDINAL WOLSEY
What say they?
Chamberlain
Such a one, they all confess,
There is indeed; which they would have your grace
Find out, and he will take it.
CARDINAL WOLSEY
Let me see, then.
By all your good leaves, gentlemen; here I'll make
My royal choice.
KING HENRY VIII
Ye have found him, cardinal:
Unmasking

You hold a fair assembly; you do well, lord:
You are a churchman, or, I'll tell you, cardinal,
I should judge now unhappily.
CARDINAL WOLSEY
I am glad
Your grace is grown so pleasant.
KING HENRY VIII
My lord chamberlain,
Prithee, come hither: what fair lady's that?
Chamberlain
An't please your grace, Sir Thomas Bullen's daughter--
The Viscount Rochford,--one of her highness' women.
KING HENRY VIII
By heaven, she is a dainty one. Sweetheart,
I were unmannerly, to take you out,
And not to kiss you. A health, gentlemen!
Let it go round.
CARDINAL WOLSEY
Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet ready
I' the privy chamber?
LOVELL
Yes, my lord.
CARDINAL WOLSEY
Your grace,
I fear, with dancing is a little heated.
KING HENRY VIII
I fear, too much.
CARDINAL WOLSEY
There's fresher air, my lord,
In the next chamber.
KING HENRY VIII
Lead in your ladies, every one: sweet partner,
