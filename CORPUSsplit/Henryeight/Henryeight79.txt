Of all this table, say so.
CROMWELL
Why, my lord?
GARDINER
Do not I know you for a favourer
Of this new sect? ye are not sound.
CROMWELL
Not sound?
GARDINER
Not sound, I say.
CROMWELL
Would you were half so honest!
Men's prayers then would seek you, not their fears.
GARDINER
I shall remember this bold language.
CROMWELL
Do.
Remember your bold life too.
Chancellor
This is too much;
Forbear, for shame, my lords.
GARDINER
I have done.
CROMWELL
And I.
Chancellor
Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed,
I take it, by all voices, that forthwith
You be convey'd to the Tower a prisoner;
There to remain till the king's further pleasure
Be known unto us: are you all agreed, lords?
All
We are.
CRANMER
Is there no other way of mercy,
But I must needs to the Tower, my lords?
GARDINER
What other
Would you expect? you are strangely troublesome.
Let some o' the guard be ready there.
Enter Guard

CRANMER
For me?
Must I go like a traitor thither?
GARDINER
Receive him,
And see him safe i' the Tower.
CRANMER
Stay, good my lords,
