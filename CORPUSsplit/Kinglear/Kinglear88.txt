CORDELIA
No cause, no cause.
KING LEAR
Am I in France?
KENT
In your own kingdom, sir.
KING LEAR
Do not abuse me.
Doctor
Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,
You see, is kill'd in him: and yet it is danger
To make him even o'er the time he has lost.
Desire him to go in; trouble him no more
Till further settling.
CORDELIA
Will't please your highness walk?
KING LEAR
You must bear with me:
Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.
Exeunt all but KENT and Gentleman

Gentleman
Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?
KENT
Most certain, sir.
Gentleman
Who is conductor of his people?
KENT
As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.
Gentleman
They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl
of Kent in Germany.
KENT
Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the
powers of the kingdom approach apace.
Gentleman
The arbitrement is like to be bloody. Fare you
well, sir.
Exit

KENT
My point and period will be throughly wrought,
Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.
Exit
