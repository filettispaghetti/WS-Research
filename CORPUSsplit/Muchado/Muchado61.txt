With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,
And I of him will gather patience.
But there is no such man: for, brother, men
Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,

To those that wring under the load of sorrow,
But no man's virtue nor sufficiency
To be so moral when he shall endure
The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:
My griefs cry louder than advertisement.

And that shall Claudio know; so shall the prince
And all of them that thus dishonour her.

DON PEDRO
Good den, good den.
CLAUDIO
Good day to both of you.
LEONATO
Hear you. my lords,--
DON PEDRO
We have some haste, Leonato.
LEONATO
Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord:
Are you so hasty now? well, all is one.
DON PEDRO
Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.
ANTONIO
If he could right himself with quarreling,
