Job 31:13	If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;
Job 31:14	What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
Job 31:15	Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?
Job 31:16	If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
Job 31:17	Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;
Job 31:18	(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)
Job 31:19	If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;
Job 31:20	If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
Job 31:21	If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:
Job 31:22	Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.
Job 31:23	For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.
Job 31:24	If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;
Job 31:25	If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much;
Job 31:26	If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;
Job 31:27	And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:
Job 31:28	This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above.
Job 31:29	If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:
Job 31:30	Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
Job 31:31	If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.
Job 31:32	The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller.
Job 31:33	If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:
Job 31:34	Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?
Job 31:35	Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.
Job 31:36	Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.
Job 31:37	I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.
Job 31:38	If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;
Job 31:39	If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:
Job 31:40	Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
Job 32:1	So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
Job 32:2	Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.
Job 32:3	Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
Job 32:4	Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.
Job 32:5	When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.
Job 32:6	And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.
Job 32:7	I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
Job 32:8	But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
Job 32:9	Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.
Job 32:10	Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.
Job 32:11	Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.
Job 32:12	Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:
Job 32:13	Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.
Job 32:14	Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.
Job 32:15	They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.
Job 32:16	When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)
Job 32:17	I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.
Job 32:18	For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
Job 32:19	Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.
Job 32:20	I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.
Job 32:21	Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.
Job 32:22	For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.
