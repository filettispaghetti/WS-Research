Job 22:16	Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:
Job 22:17	Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?

Job 23:1	Then Job answered and said,
Job 23:2	Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.

Job 23:4	I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
Job 23:5	I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.
Job 23:6	Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.
Job 23:7	There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
Job 23:8	Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:
Job 23:9	On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:
Job 23:10	But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
Job 23:11	My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.

Job 23:14	For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.
Job 23:15	Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.
Job 23:16	For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:
Job 23:17	Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.
