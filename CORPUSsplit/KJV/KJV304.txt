Psalms 77:8	Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?
Psalms 77:9	Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
Psalms 77:10	And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.
Psalms 77:11	I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.
Psalms 77:12	I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.
Psalms 77:13	Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?
Psalms 77:14	Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.
Psalms 77:15	Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
Psalms 77:16	The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.
Psalms 77:17	The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.
Psalms 77:18	The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.
Psalms 77:19	Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.
Psalms 77:20	Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
Psalms 78:1	Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
Psalms 78:2	I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
Psalms 78:3	Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
Psalms 78:4	We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
Psalms 78:5	For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:
Psalms 78:6	That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:
Psalms 78:7	That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:
Psalms 78:8	And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
Psalms 78:9	The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
Psalms 78:10	They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
Psalms 78:11	And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
Psalms 78:12	Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
Psalms 78:13	He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.
Psalms 78:14	In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
Psalms 78:15	He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.
Psalms 78:16	He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
Psalms 78:17	And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
Psalms 78:18	And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
Psalms 78:19	Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
Psalms 78:20	Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
Psalms 78:21	Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
Psalms 78:22	Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
Psalms 78:23	Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
Psalms 78:24	And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
Psalms 78:25	Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.
Psalms 78:26	He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
Psalms 78:27	He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
Psalms 78:28	And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
Psalms 78:29	So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
Psalms 78:30	They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,
Psalms 78:31	The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.
Psalms 78:32	For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
Psalms 78:33	Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
Psalms 78:34	When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.
Psalms 78:35	And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
Psalms 78:36	Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
Psalms 78:37	For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
