LUCIO
Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as
things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;
impiety has made a feast of thee.

First Gentleman
How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?
MISTRESS OVERDONE
Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried
to prison was worth five thousand of you all.
Second Gentleman
Who's that, I pray thee?
MISTRESS OVERDONE
Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.
First Gentleman
Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.
MISTRESS OVERDONE
Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw
him carried away; and, which is more, within these
three days his head to be chopped off.
LUCIO
But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.
Art thou sure of this?
MISTRESS OVERDONE
I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam
Julietta with child.
LUCIO
Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two
hours since, and he was ever precise in
promise-keeping.
Second Gentleman
Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
speech we had to such a purpose.
First Gentleman
But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.
LUCIO
Away! let's go learn the truth of it.
Exeunt LUCIO and Gentlemen

MISTRESS OVERDONE
Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
with the gallows and what with poverty, I am
custom-shrunk.
Enter POMPEY

How now! what's the news with you?
POMPEY
Yonder man is carried to prison.
