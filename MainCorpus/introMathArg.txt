A mathematical proof is an argument which convinces other people that
something is true. Math isn’t a court of law, so a “preponderance of the
evidence” or “beyond any reasonable doubt” isn’t good enough. In principle
we try to prove things beyond any doubt at all — although in real life people
make mistakes, and total rigor can be impractical for large projects. (There
are also some subtleties in the foundations of mathematics, such as Godel’s
theorem, but never mind.)
Anyway, there is a certain vocabulary and grammar that underlies all
mathematical proofs. The vocabulary includes logical words such as ‘or’,
‘if’, etc. These words have very precise meanings in mathematics which can
differ slightly from everyday usage. By “grammar”, I mean that there are
certain common-sense principles of logic, or proof techniques, which you can
use to start with statements which you know and deduce statements which
you didn’t know before.
